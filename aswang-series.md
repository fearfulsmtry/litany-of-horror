## About Aswang

In Philippine folklore, the _aswang_ is a shapeshifting predator that preys on the unborn and the newly born. It wears the face of a friend, a neighbor, even a midwife, moving through the village by day and feeding in secret by night.

Legends say it can split its body, slip through walls, and drink life from the womb. Some stories warn that it passes its curse to a chosen heir — an unholy inheritance given mouth-to-mouth.

In Aswang, these ancient terrors survive into the present, where old prayers and older fears still hold power, and faith becomes both shield and battleground against the darkness.
