## About Anak

_Anak_ means "child" in Filipino, but it carries deeper weightâ€”referring not just to offspring, but to the bond that defines parent and child, the identity that comes with nurturing life.

In this psychological horror, the absence of that bond becomes its own haunting presence. Set against the backdrop of modern fertility struggles, _Anak_ explores how desperation can transform love into something unrecognizable, and how the things we most desperately want can become the very things that destroy us.

The story examines the shadow side of parenthoodâ€”not the joy of new life, but the consuming grief of its absence, and the lengths to which people will go to fill that void.
