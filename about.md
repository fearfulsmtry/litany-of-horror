### *Stories from the edge of faith.*

---

Welcome to **Litany of Horror**—a collection of original, slow-burning tales where **evil is real**, seductive, and ancient—but never omnipotent.

These are stories shaped by horror and grace, drawn from folklore, theology, and the spiritual inheritance of generations past. They explore the world **as it is**: haunted, holy, broken, and worth redeeming.

Here, you’ll find:
- Prayers whispered in crumbling chapels.
- Relics hidden beneath floorboards.
- And darkness that flees—not from noise, but from *grace*.

### 👁 Start with our first serialized story:  
🩸 **[Aswang – Part I: Echoes in the Earth](/aswang/part-i-echoes-in-the-earth/)**

> *“You don’t need to believe everything,” her mother once said.  
> “Just remember where you came from, anak.”*

### ☩ What to Expect

- Stories told in **parts**, like oral tradition or novena vigils
- Horror that flows from **spiritual realism**, not shock
- The Church—flawed but enduring—watching from the margins
- Evil that must be confronted **bodily**, not just banished

### 🌒 Upcoming
