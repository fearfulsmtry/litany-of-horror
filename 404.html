  <h1 class="page-title">404: Page not found</h1>
  <p class="lead">Sorry, we've misplaced that URL or it's pointing to something that doesn't exist. Like a ghost in the night, it has vanished without a trace.</p>
  
  <p>Perhaps the page you seek has been consumed by the darkness, or maybe it never existed at all. The internet can be a mysterious place, full of broken links and digital phantoms.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Head back <a href="{{ '/' | relative_url }}">home</a> to safety, brave traveler.</strong></p>
