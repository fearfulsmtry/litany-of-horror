**Part III - The Nothing That Speaks**

_“O my God, I cry by day, but you do not answer; and by night, but find no rest.” - Psalm 22:2_

---

The clinic smelled of antiseptic. White walls. Frosted glass. A print of eucalyptus trees hung crooked above the chairs.

Chel sat with her hands in her lap, fingers locked tight. Jacob scrolled his phone, thumb moving fast, face unreadable.

The door opened. A doctor in a pale coat, clipboard under his arm. He gestured them in.

The office was small, lit too bright. A monitor glowed with magnified cells, round and pale, frozen in time. The doctor cleared his throat, voice careful.

“I’m very sorry,” he said. “This doesn’t happen often, but I want to be upfront with you. None of the eggs fertilised. This is what we call a total fertilisation failure.” He paused, eyes steady on them. “It means there were no embryos.”

The words hung in the air, clean and clinical.

Chel blinked. The sound bent in her ears, warped. _There was nothing. There will always be nothing._

Her breath stuttered. She dug her nails into her palms, holding tight.

Jacob leaned forward, too quick. “So… we try again. Next round, we change the protocol.” His voice was clipped, already grasping at control.

The doctor nodded slowly, choosing his words. “It’s possible to try again. But in cases like this… the chances of success are very low.”

Chel’s chest hollowed. The words echoed jagged inside her. _There is nothing. There will always be nothing._

Jacob shifted, jaw tightening. He opened his mouth, then shut it again.

The doctor cleared his throat. “I know this is difficult news. Take some time. My office will call to arrange follow-up.” His tone was soft, but final.

Jacob spoke briefly to the doctor with more questions, as if unable to fully accept the news.

Chel rose before they finished. The chair scraped sharp against the tiles. Jacob also fell silent, stood up, eyes lowered.

They left the office without a word.

The corridor stretched long, lined with closed doors. Chel walked fast, Jacob behind her, their footsteps echoing on the polished floor. At the exit the glass doors sighed open, spilling them into daylight.

Outside, the street hummed with traffic, a tram rattling past. Life went on.

Chel stood still on the pavement, arms folded tight across her chest. Jacob reached for her shoulder.

She stepped away.

The silence between them was heavier than the city noise, heavier than the clinic’s antiseptic air.

---

The townhouse was dark when they returned. Jacob dropped his keys on the counter, the sound sharp against the silence. He stayed in the kitchen, pouring water, opening and shutting cupboards with no aim.

Chel went straight upstairs. She slipped off her shoes and lay on the bed fully dressed, arms folded across her stomach.

The doctor’s words replayed, clean and clinical. _None of the eggs fertilised. There were no embryos._ But beneath them another voice threaded sharp: _There was nothing. There will always be nothing._

She pressed her palms flat on her stomach, willing it not to be true. Her eyes burned. She stared at the ceiling until it blurred.

Downstairs a cupboard slammed shut. Jacob’s footsteps paced the tiles, quick, restless. Then silence.

He came up at last, collar open, face set hard. He stood at the bedroom door, watching her.

“We’ll try again,” he said. His voice was low, clipped. “Change the treatment. Different clinic, if we have to.”

Chel didn’t answer.

Jacob stepped closer. “Chel. We’re not finished. Persistence pays. We just keep at it.”

Her lips parted. “They said the chances are low.”

“They didn’t say impossible.”

She turned her head toward him. “It sounded like impossible.”

Jacob’s jaw tightened. He looked away, then back. “We’ll prove them wrong.”

Chel rolled onto her side, facing the wall. “I can’t do this again.”

Silence stretched. Jacob stood still, fists clenched at his sides. For a moment it looked as if he might shout, but he only exhaled sharp through his nose.

“Fine,” he said. “Rest. We’ll talk later.”

He left the room, the door clicking shut behind him.

Chel curled tighter on the bed, arms wrapped across her stomach. The ache was worse than empty — it was final. The whisper echoed inside her, thin and jagged: _There was nothing. There will always be nothing._

Downstairs, Jacob poured another glass of water, though he didn’t drink. He stood at the counter staring into it, jaw locked, as if the surface might yield an answer.

The townhouse held its silence.

Morning light thinned through the townhouse windows.

Chel sat in the lounge with a cup of tea cooling in her hands. Jacob had left early, no word, only the sound of the door clicking shut behind him.

The orchids on the sill stood stiff, their petals too bright. The sketchbook was still half-hidden under the cushion where she had left it weeks ago.

Chel pulled it free, thumb brushing the worn cover. She opened it slowly, page by page — facades she had sketched for clients, arches, windows, clean lines. Then the cradle.

Thin bars. Soft canopy curved like a prayer.

The ache was unbearable. She pressed her palm flat on the page, as if to erase it.

She turned the sheet.

Another cradle. The same outline, but twisted — bars bent inward, the canopy sagging.

Chel blinked, fingers trembling. This was not her drawing. She flipped again.

Another cradle. Darker now. The bars jagged, shadows heavy in the corners.

Her breath caught. She turned faster.

Page after page. Each cradle worse than the last. Shadows gathering, lines thickening into a smear of black.

And then — something else.

A figure in the cradle. Small. Hunched. On one page it lay still. On the next it stirred. Another — it was sitting up, head bowed.

Chel’s breath faltered. Her hands shook as she flipped.

Page after page, the figure rose slowly, motion caught in the paper like a cruel animation. The pages began to depict its head turning toward her, the blur of its face about to be revealed.

Chel slammed the sketchbook shut before she could see.

The sound cracked through the lounge.

Silence poured back into the room.

The orchids gleamed in the pale light. The rug lay flat.

Chel shoved the sketchbook back under the cushion, quick and rough, as though burying it could undo what she had seen.

She stayed pressed into the lounge cushions, arms tight across her chest, eyes fixed on the cushion where it lay hidden, afraid to touch it again.

The church was full of light. Sun poured through coloured panes, spilling red and blue across the pews. Families crowded the rows, faces warm, expectant.

Chel sat stiff beside Jacob. Her throat burned.

At the font the priest lifted the infant, white gown spilling over his arm. He traced the sign of the cross on a damp forehead. The baby wailed, fists trembling. The congregation smiled, laughter rippling gentle through the nave.

Chel’s vision blurred. She gripped the edge of the pew, knuckles white. _We will never stand here. Never hold a child of our own._

Beside her Jacob shifted, gaze fixed on the floor. His jaw tightened, unmoving.

The rite ended. A hymn rose, voices swelling. Family crowded forward, pressing close, congratulating, taking turns to cradle the child. The nave was loud with joy.

Chel stayed seated, hands clasped in her lap, chest hollow.

Later, in the hall, tables sagged under food. A whole lechon gleamed bronze, skin blistered crisp. Platters of noodles steamed, lumpia stacked high, trays of rice spilling at the edges. Children shrieked between chairs, laughter sharp as bells.

Chel sat at the corner, untouched plate before her.

Mai slipped into the seat beside her, hand warm on her arm. “Ate,” she whispered. “You look pale.”

Chel’s lips trembled. “We tried. There’s nothing. No embryos. The doctor said the chances are almost zero.” Her voice cracked. She drew a breath, fighting tears. “And I’ve been dreaming… babies turning to ash in my arms. Cradles rocking in the dark. I see things, Mai. I don’t know what’s real anymore.”

Mai’s eyes blurred. She squeezed Chel’s hand, voice breaking soft. “I’m so sorry, Ate.” She let the words breathe, heavy with love. Then she leaned closer. “I’m always here for you. Why don’t you come with me to church? There are some wounds only God can heal.”

Chel nodded faintly, though her gaze stayed on the floor.

Across the hall Cecilia pressed a plate into Jacob’s hands. Her eyes softened as she searched his face.  
“Anak,” she said gently, “I know this is hard. Harder than most can imagine.”

Jacob lowered his gaze. The untouched food trembled faintly in his grip.

Cecilia laid a hand on his arm, firm but tender. “You’ve carried this like a burden you must solve. Always pushing, always trying to control. But some things… Jacob, some things are not ours to hold.”

His throat worked as he swallowed.

“Let it go into God’s hands. He works for the good of all things. Even where we cannot see it yet. He has a plan.”

Cecilia smiled, her palm pressing his arm. “He will not abandon you. Neither will we. You are not alone.”

Jacob looked at her, jaw easing. The fight drained out of his eyes, replaced with something rawer, quieter. He nodded once, holding her gaze.

---

The townhouse lay silent, night pressed heavy.

Jacob stirred awake. His eyes opened, but his body did not move.

He lay flat, chest heaving shallow. Panic clawed up his throat. He tried to lift an arm, a leg — nothing. His limbs were stone.

Then he felt it.

A weight on his chest. Small, but crushing.

Jacob’s gaze rolled down. A shape crouched over him — toddler-sized, limbs bent backward, head swollen, face lost in shadow. Its joints clicked softly, insect-like.

The pressure deepened. His ribs creaked, each breath shallower than the last.

The smell rose sharp in his nostrils — sour-sweet, like spoiled milk. Warm breath brushed his cheek.

A voice whispered close, jagged, broken:  
_“You left me…”_

Jacob’s throat seized. He tried to shout, but only a ragged wheeze escaped.

The thing’s head lifted slowly. Its milky eyes caught the faint streetlight. The whisper came again, closer, curling into his ear:  
_“Papa…”_

His chest splintered with pain. He thought his ribs might crack. Spots flared at the edges of his vision.

Jacob roared in his mind, forcing every ounce of strength into a single surge. With a strangled cry his body broke free — arms thrashing, chest heaving. The weight vanished.

He rolled to his side, gasping, sweat soaking the sheets. His lip stung. When he touched it, his fingers came away red.

The room was empty. Beside him, Chel slept on, unmoved.

Jacob lay rigid, staring at the ceiling. The whisper still echoed in his skull, faint and jagged:  
_Papa…_

The townhouse held its silence.
