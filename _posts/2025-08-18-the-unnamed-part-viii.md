**Part VIII - The Naming**

_“They broke the place of his dwelling, and the shadow departed.”_

---

They returned to the compound in near-silence, tyres hissing over damp road. The roadside where the wandering souls had stood was empty now, only wind through the pines.

Inside, Anding clutched Elia’s hands as though to prove she was real. The girl sat upright, pale but awake, her eyes following every movement. Len pressed a cup of ginger tea into her hands.

Elia’s gaze drifted past them, toward the dark mouth of the sala. “It’s still sitting there,” she said softly, like she was describing the weather. “It knows you’re coming.”

For a breath, it seemed the nightmare was behind them — until Len swayed.

Gabi caught her elbow. Her skin was clammy, pupils slow to respond. He brushed back her fringe and saw the mark, faint but angry, as if scorched into her skin.

Kin stepped closer, frowning. “It should have faded.” His eyes flicked toward the sala. “It hasn’t let go.”

The air in the house felt wrong — colder than the wind outside, shadows pooling in corners. The vigil candles hissed as though damp. In Gabi’s mind, Lolo Ben’s face at the wake hadn’t been twisted like it was now.

Kin’s jaw tightened. “We can’t wait for the bishop. If we do nothing, it will finish what it started with Len.”

Anding’s knuckles whitened on her rosary. “Here? You’ll do the rite here?”

“In the sala,” Kin said. “It began there. It ends there.”

Kin moved at once — retrieving his stole, the battered ritual book, and the small vial of holy water he’d carried since seminary.  
Gabi pulled the toolbox from the corner, taking out a claw hammer without knowing exactly why. Just holding it felt like a promise.

Len stepped into the doorway, pale but steady. “I’m not leaving,” she said.

Kin hesitated, then nodded once. “Stay near Gabi. If it turns on you, he pulls you clear.”

A floorboard groaned from the sala — the weight of something settling where no one sat.

They crossed the threshold together. The air inside was colder than the fog outside. Candlelight bent away from the vigil chair. 

Kin stepped into the sala, stole around his neck, ritual book in one hand, holy water in the other. Candlelight bent away from the vigil chair, shadows pooling in corners.

“Exorcizo te, omnis spiritus immunde…” His voice was steady, deliberate.

The air turned colder than the fog outside. A deep rasp answered him — not from the corpse, but from the chair itself. The wood flexed, groaning under a weight no one could see. The vigil candles hissed, their flames pulling away as if in dread.

“In nomine Iesu Christi, Domini nostri—”

The rasp thickened into words. ***“Little priest. You mouth the syllables of men older than your bones, hoping the dark will mistake sound for light.”***

Kin didn’t falter. “In the name of Jesus Christ, leave this house.”

***“This house is mine,”*** it said, voice low and deliberate. ***“My throne stands in its heart. Every soul who kept vigil here bent their head to me, even if they thought they prayed elsewhere.”***

“You have no throne here,” Kin shot back.

***“Then strike it down,”*** the voice purred.

**Then — a pounding rattled the front door.**

Gabi moved, eyes still on the corpse. He yanked the door open — and Carlos lurched in. His shirt was torn, face slick with sweat, eyes glassy. The stench hit Gabi: cold, damp earth, the same as the vigil chair.

“This is your fault,” Carlos hissed, but the voice behind it wasn’t his. His gaze slid to Len. The smile that followed didn’t belong to him at all.

He lunged. Gabi intercepted, shoving him back. They slammed into the wall. Carlos swung, wild, but Gabi drove him down, pinning him.

***“Strike him down, boy,”*** the thing inside Carlos taunted. ***“You know you want to.”***

“Not this time.” Gabi held him — until Carlos twisted free, stumbling toward the chair.

The air snapped electric. Fog curled at the window. An invisible force seized Carlos and hurled him through the glass in an explosion of shards. For a heartbeat he hung there, skewered on the frame, blood spilling hot down the wall — then the fog poured in, and the demon laughed.

Carlos’s body slid from the shattered frame and hit the ground with a sickening crack. He didn’t move again.

Kin’s voice cut through it, urgent: _“Adjuro te, spiritus immunde, per Deum omnipotentem—”_

---

The demon’s laughter swelled, bouncing off the walls until it felt as though the whole house spoke.

***“You wear the words of others like armor, but your eyes give you away. When she stumbles, will you lift her for the altar… or for your own hands?”***

Kin’s grip tightened on the stole, his voice unbroken.

***“And the boy,”*** it went on, turning toward Gabi. ***“He turned his back when the earth called him home. He left his blood to sink into the soil, and now returns with empty hands, thinking the soil will not remember.”***

Gabi’s jaw set.

***“And her…”*** The voice softened, thick with possession. ***“I have worn your name like gravecloth in the dark, turned it over until it no longer knew your tongue. When the earth takes you, I will rest at your side. When they call for you, it will be my voice that answers.”***

Len’s lips trembled — but then she stood straighter, eyes locking on the shadow massing around the chair.

“I am Elena Ramos. You will not name me as yours. I give myself to those I *love* — and you are nothing.”

The laughter fractured into a hiss. The shadow writhed against the chair as if bound by chains no one could see.

Kin felt the shift — the binding drawn tighter, the power bleeding from it like air from a pierced lung. The moment was now.

“Give me your name,” he said.

He repeated forcefully. “In the Name of Jesus Christ, I **command** you — give me your name.”

The shadow bucked against the chair, a low roar swelling, then cracking into a shriek. The sound tore itself apart, breaking into a single word: **_“Bangkilan.”_**

The candles thinned to trembling pins of light. The air seemed to pull inward, heavy with the shape of the name.

---

The corpse of Lolo Ben unfolded jerkily to its feet — joints snapping, head lolling at an angle too far to one side. The burial clothes hung loose over its withered frame, but the presence inside was vast, crowding the room until every breath felt stolen.

The skin at the throat split as something pushed from within — long, blackened limbs straining against the husk of flesh, the jaw cracking wider until the face was less a man’s and more a mask peeled back for something else to look through.

Gabi’s stomach clenched — it was the same shifting shadow he’d glimpsed over Carlos in the cave, the same wrong shape that had watched from the dark.

The corpse stepped away from the chair, and for an instant, he saw both — the husk of his lolo and the towering, twisted silhouette that was not his lolo at all. Its head nearly brushed the rafters, crowned with antler-like spurs of bone, its eyes molten pinpoints set deep in shadow.

Gabi felt the temperature drop again and knew, somehow, that the thing was bound here, anchored. His eyes went to the vigil chair — the seat where every horror had begun — and he moved before thought could catch him.

“Kin!” he shouted, “It’s in the chair!”

---

Gabi’s eyes locked on the chair — the “throne” the demon claimed. He gripped the hammer and stepped forward.

“*Bangkilan*,” Kin’s voice rang out, steady and cold. “In the Name of Jesus Christ, I cast you down.”

Gabi swung. The first blow caved in the seat with a splintering crack.

“*Bangkilan*,” Kin repeated over the demon’s shriek. “Leave this vessel. Leave this place.”

The second strike shattered the carved arms, fragments scattering across the floor.

The shadow reeled, writhing, and hurled itself toward Kin in a last act of defiance. It struck like lightning, the force slamming him against the wall. Darkness coiled around his head, searing hot and ice-cold in the same breath, the burn sinking deep into skin and bone.

He gasped, the taste of iron flooding his mouth, and for a heartbeat the blackness pressed in — whispering his own doubts, his own longings — before it burst away in a hiss of smoke.

His hand trembled on the stole, but he forced himself forward, crucifix raised high.

“**Bangkilan**!” Kin’s shout rose to match the hammer’s fall. The high back split, collapsing inward until the chair was nothing but wreckage.

The throne was broken.

> “By the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, **I command you** — be cast out and return to the pit from which you came!”

The thing tried to speak, but the name — its true name — seemed to choke it. The corpse bent backward, bones cracking, shadow boiling off its skin like smoke.

The shadow writhed, shrank, and was pulled back into itself, collapsing into nothing with a sound like a breath drawn too sharply.

The body of Lolo Ben sagged to the ground, empty, at last still.

---

The air in the sala hung heavy, still vibrating with the echo of the demon’s scream. The last fragments of the chair smoldered in the corner, the wood blackened, curling in on itself.

Kin stood in the middle of it, breathing hard, crucifix still clenched in his hand. His stole hung crooked over one shoulder, one side torn. The left side of his face was marked — an angry welt cutting from temple to jaw, already beginning to swell.

Len rushed to him first. “Kin...” She stopped short, her breath catching. The hair at his temples — once jet black — was now stark white, the color leeching all the way through, as if the years had just claimed him in a single moment.

Gabi came up beside her, his gaze flicking from the scar to the ruined chair. “You’re hurt.”

Kin shook his head once. “Not as badly as it was hurt.” He nodded toward the empty space where Lolo Ben’s body had been — only the burial cloth remained, folded neatly on the floor. “He’s gone… the right way this time.”

Len’s hand brushed lightly against the welt on Kin’s cheek. “There will be a mark,” she murmured.

“A reminder,” Kin said, his voice quiet but steady. “Some things we carry so we never forget.”

Len let out a slow breath, the tension in her shoulders loosening. Without thinking, she touched her forehead — and found only smooth skin. The searing welt was gone, as if it had never been there.

Her eyes flicked to Kin, to the fresh white in his hair and the raw welt on his cheek. Realisation settled in her expression — the mark had passed from her, but his would remain.
