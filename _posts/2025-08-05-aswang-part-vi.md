**Aswang – Part VI: The Pasa**  

_"Claim the womb. Twist the breath. Inherit the hunger."_
_(From the rite of Pasa)_

---

The light had turned.

It wasn’t night yet, but the color had gone wrong—too orange, too still. Like something was holding the sun in place, unwilling to let it fall until the curtain closed.

Miguel stepped down from the ladder, wiping sweat from his brow. “That should hold,” he muttered.

No answer.

He turned toward the door.

“Anna?”

The house was too quiet.

He checked the kitchen.

Empty.

Bedroom.

Empty.

The back door hung slightly ajar—just wide enough to invite something in.

He stepped forward slowly.

On the table sat the relic.

Anna never left it behind.

Next to it, a half-drunk cup of salabat. Still warm.

Miguel’s pulse ticked upward. “Anna,” he called, louder now.

No answer.

He moved to the front of the house and shouted into the yard.

“Lito!”

---

Tatay Lito came around the corner, breathing hard. “What is it?”

“She’s gone.”

He didn’t ask _are you sure_. He didn’t waste time.

He followed Miguel back inside, scanning the doorframe, the floorboards, the salt line.

Disturbed.

Barely—but enough.

Outside, beneath the window, a branch had snapped cleanly. Footprints—light, but visible—led into the tree line.

Lito knelt beside them.

“She didn’t run,” he said grimly. “She followed.”

Miguel’s fists clenched. “We have to go.”

Lito stood.

He moved quickly to his small satchel near the altar and opened it.

Out came a pouch of salt.

A bottle of holy water.

A small, flask-sized vial of oil.

A folded cloth containing the **old orasyon**, handwritten in faded ink.

And then—**his bolo knife**.

He unsheathed it slowly.

The blade was clean. Worn. Familiar.

He looked at Miguel.

> “We go now. Not just to protect her. To end this.”

Miguel nodded.

Lito held up the **relic**—the brass disk that had burned Belen’s flesh when it touched her veil weeks ago.

> “Take this. It’s not a weapon. But it will do what no blade can.”  
> “Press it to her skin. Her eyes. Her altar. The holy doesn’t burn the living.”

Miguel took it and slipped it into the small pouch at his chest.

Then Lito did something unexpected.

He placed his hand on Miguel’s shoulder.

And whispered:

> _“Your lola died standing. Not pleading.  
> We do the same.”_

---

The two men stepped out into the orange haze.

The forest waited.

Behind them, the candles inside the house burned low—but steady.

Ahead, the path curved toward the mountain, where the air grew thinner, and the **bamboo never sang**.

---

#### **Anna – Inside the Grove**

---

The path narrowed as they reached the grove.

Anna hesitated once—just as the shadows began to close around the trail. But Mira kept walking, barefoot, sure-footed.

The trees here were older. Taller. Their trunks gnarled like knotted hands in prayer.

But no birds sang in their branches.

And no insects moved in the soil.

Only silence.

---

The hut was smaller than she remembered from childhood. Its roof was sagging, but its foundation was strong. Old stone, darkened with moss and soot.

Mira stopped just before the threshold.

Inside, a **single candle burned black**.

The smell hit Anna like a wall: blood. Salt. Smoke. And something sweeter. Almost… rotting fruit.

Still, she stepped forward.

“Where is it?” she asked.

Mira didn’t look at her.

She only whispered, “I’m sorry.”

---

Hands grabbed Anna from the side.

Too fast. Too strong.

She screamed, kicked—but her body felt slow, uncooperative. Something cloying rose in her throat—was it something she drank? Something she smelled?

**Belen** stepped from the shadows.

Her skin looked smoother than before. Her hair longer. Her smile…

**Too kind.**

> “Oh, anak. You came willingly. That makes it beautiful.”

She pressed two fingers to Anna’s stomach.

The baby flinched.

And Anna’s knees gave out.

---

She was bound quickly.

Not with rope—but with **strips of old baptismal gowns**, stained and fraying. The knots were wet. The cloth had been soaked in something—oil? Wine?

She lay on her side now, trembling.

Around her: the altar.

- A cracked porcelain statue of the Santo Niño, face **chiseled off**.
    
- Rosaries made of **umbilical cords**, braided with black hair.
    
- A basin filled with water that steamed—not from heat, but **cold**.
    
- A page torn from a missal, inverted and nailed to the wall upside down.
    

Belen stood before it, humming softly. Something close to a lullaby.

> “Tonight,” she said, “you’ll bring life. But not yours. Not God’s.  
> _Ours._”

---

Anna turned her head toward Mira.

The girl stood by the doorway.

Still. Pale.

Their eyes met.

Something passed between them.

A long ache.

Anna whispered, hoarsely: “Help me.”

Mira’s lip quivered.

She took one step forward.

Then stopped.

> “I can’t,” she said.

And looked away.

---

Belen opened her mouth.

And began to sing.

---

The candlelight in the hut shifted.

It flickered not with wind, but with **presence**—as if something unseen had entered. Something called.

Belen raised both hands.

She stood in front of the cracked altar, humming low. Her back to Anna. Her veil trembled, though there was no breeze.

She spoke—not to Anna. Not to Mira.

But to _something else_.

> “Blood received. Child ripened. Circle breached. The gate is ready.”

She turned slowly.

Her eyes had changed.

No longer soft brown.

**Pupil-less. Flat. As if scraped clean.**

Her smile spread wider than her face should allow, revealing too many teeth—not fanged, not monstrous.

**Just too human.**

Too deliberate.

She stepped forward, holding the basin of steaming water.

Anna tried to crawl back, but her arms wouldn’t move. Her legs felt disconnected, distant.

She felt pressure in her womb. A turning.

> “Do not fear,” Belen whispered. “All births are pain. Even this one.”

---

She dipped her fingers into the basin.

Then **flicked water** onto Anna’s forehead.

It stung.

Burned—not with heat, but with **wrongness**.

A reverse sacrament. A desecration.

> “You have been claimed,” Belen intoned. “Not by blood, but by will. Not by heaven, but by power.”

She reached into a carved wooden bowl and withdrew a bundle wrapped in old leaves.

It pulsed faintly.

Anna’s breath caught.

The **pasa.**

It looked like a dark, slick stone—but it beat. Just once.

Like a heart that had forgotten how to die.

---

Belen lifted it.

Her voice rose into chant. Not Latin. Not any known tongue.

But the words **vibrated** in Anna’s bones.

She saw Mira flinch.

Heard her whisper: “Not yet. It’s not ready.”

Belen turned toward her—slowly.

> “Then we feed it.”

She stepped toward Anna and knelt.

The pasa hovered over Anna’s stomach now, just inches from the womb.

And then—

**Belen began to change.**

---

It began at her hands.

The skin _peeled back_, not bloodily, but like bark curling from a dead tree.

Her fingers lengthened, then _split_—tendons exposed like delicate rootwork.

Her neck twisted once, then twice—vertebrae cracking in slow, rhythmic snaps.

Her veil slipped.

And beneath it—

Not a face.

Not anymore.

Just **the suggestion** of one. Like something pretending to be a woman had painted human features on stretched wax.

Her lips moved.

And the pasa **lowered**.

Anna screamed—

And the candle beside the altar **exploded.**
