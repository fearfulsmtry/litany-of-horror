**Part IV - The Circle Tightens** 

_“The door was shut, but the enemy was among them.”_

---

The fog still clung to the pines when Kin woke. The house was quiet — no clatter of plates from the kitchen, no low hum of voices from the sala.

He padded to the small office beside the chapel, the one Lolo Ben used for keeping clan records. The air inside smelled of paper and candle wax. He flicked on the desk lamp and sat before the old desktop computer, its screen casting a pale glow across his face.

His fingers hovered over the keys for a long moment before he began.

> **Subject:** Request for Pastoral Guidance  
> **Your Excellency,**  
> I write from my family home in Baguio, where I am on leave to attend the vigil of my grandfather, Benjamin Sagayo. I am concerned by a series of disturbances within the household — movements in empty rooms, changes to objects left untouched, and one incident involving a child being drawn toward the vigil chair.
> 
> I hesitate to speculate on the nature of these events. Some may be attributed to grief, fatigue, or imagination. But others… I cannot explain.
> 
> I request your counsel on the matter and whether further pastoral intervention is warranted.
> 
> Yours in Christ,  
> Rev. Fr. Joaquin Sagayo

He read it twice before sending, resisting the urge to add more. If he wrote everything, it would sound like panic — and panic was a poor case for permission. But the polite wording felt dishonest, too thin for the weight pressing on the house. 

He’d already done this once in the seminary, swallowing urgency to keep in line with the chain of command. It had cost someone dearly then. 

He prayed this wouldn’t be the same.

Kin leaned back, exhaling. He glanced at the crucifix above the desk. It was steady now, just as it had been yesterday morning, but he couldn’t shake the memory of it turning in the night.

Outside, the fog shifted, brushing past the chapel windows as though it were listening.

---

The road to the Sagayo compound was quiet at mid-morning, the fog thinning just enough to show the pines. Len balanced the covered dish in both hands, feeling the heat of the rice seep through the woven trivet beneath. It was nothing elaborate — garlic fried rice with bits of longganisa — but it was fresh, still warm, and made in the hope that the smell alone might coax someone in the house to eat.

She stepped through the gate, greeted by the low murmur of voices from inside. The old house stood as she remembered — wood darkened by rain and years, roofline jagged against the sky.

The sala was dim. She could see the vigil chair from the doorway, Lolo Ben sitting there as still as a carved saint, the shadows moving on the wall behind him. A pang hit her chest — the same quiet authority in his face, even now.

Tita Anding met her at the door.  
“Len. Anak.”  
She kissed Anding’s cheek and murmured, “Tita. Po.” The honorific slipped out without thinking. “I brought food.”

Anding lifted the lid just enough to let the scent escape, her eyes closing for half a second. “Ay, salamat. They forget to eat when there’s mourning. Come in, come in.”

Len stepped into the sala, and that’s when she saw him.

Gabi stood at the far side of the room, near the window where the fog pressed its pale face to the glass. For a moment, he didn’t move. Then he crossed the space between them, slower than she expected.

She’d thought she would be angry - that old, hollow ache from when he left still sat somewhere under her ribs. But as he came closer, the years seemed to blur. He was broader now, his face more defined, the boyishness replaced by something steadier.

“Len.” His voice was low, cautious.

She managed a smile, small but warm, and shifted the dish to one hand so she could embrace him lightly with the other. His back was solid under her palm. He didn’t hug long, but long enough for her to notice the quiet strength in him — and to wonder if it had always been there, or if life away had shaped it.

“I almost didn’t recognize you,” she said.  
“Ten years will do that,” he replied.

They stood there a moment too long, until Anding’s voice broke in, calling her to the kitchen. Len followed, but her mind stayed behind — with the look in his eyes, like he’d been about to say something and decided against it.

---

From the hallway, Kin caught sight of them — Len at the counter, Gabi stepping closer. 

It was nothing improper. A shared smile. An easy word. 

But the familiarity between them landed like a stone in his chest, stirring a grief he thought he’d given fully to God. 

He looked away before either of them noticed, telling himself the weight in his throat was just the fog.

---

Gabi watched her go, the swing of her hair catching a strand of light from the kitchen window. She moved with the same quiet confidence he remembered — that grace that had once made every other girl fade into the background.

He should have followed her. Said something more than a few short words. But his throat had tightened the moment she smiled at him, and all the old noise in his head came rushing back — the excuses, the things left unsaid, the years he’d let pile up between them.

And yet… she’d hugged him. Briefly, yes, but without hesitation. Her hand had rested on his back just long enough for him to feel her warmth through the fabric of his shirt.

Anding’s voice carried from the kitchen, something about warming the rice. Len answered with a small laugh. That sound pulled him toward the doorway before he even realized he was moving.

He leaned against the frame. “Smells good,” he said.  
Len glanced over her shoulder at him, a strand of hair falling loose. “It’s nothing fancy. You probably eat better in Australia.”  
“I’ve had worse,” he said. 

She handed him the dish and smiled faintly. “You still box?”

He blinked. “Not much. Work keeps me busy.”

“Shame,” she said, turning toward the kitchen. “You were good.”

Then, after a pause: “I’ve missed this. Missed… you.”

Her hands stilled on the spoon. She kept her eyes on the pan, as if stirring were a matter of necessity, not choice. When she finally spoke, her voice was even, but softer than before. “That’s a long time to miss someone.”

Before he could say more, footsteps sounded in the sala — Kin’s voice, calling for him. The moment slipped, like fog burned away by the sun.

---

The study smelled faintly of camphor and old paper. Afternoon light slanted through the fog-muted windows, turning the dust in the air to pale threads. Gabi sat at Lolo Ben’s desk, a spread of clan records and photographs laid out before him.

Len moved quietly along the shelves, sliding a stack of old albums onto the desk. She brushed dust from the covers before opening the first one. “Some of these go back to your great-grandfather’s time,” she said.

Gabi flipped through stiff black-and-white portraits — solemn faces, squared shoulders, eyes locked on the lens. Then his hand stilled on one photograph: two young men in their twenties, standing side by side.

Ben’s stance was solid, calm. The other man leaned forward slightly, a faint smile ghosting his lips, eyes sharper, restless.

On the back, in pencil: _Ben & Levi, 1962._

Kin entered just then, shaking rain from his shoulders. His eyes fell to the photo, and his voice was quiet. “Levi.”  
“You know him?” Gabi asked.  
“Only by name. Stories the elders whispered.” Kin’s tone was clipped.

Len looked between them. “Let’s ask Tita.”

---

They found Anding in the kitchen, binding banana leaves with twine for suman. The scent of coconut milk and steamed rice filled the air.

“Tita,” Len said, holding up the photograph. “Do you remember this?”

Anding’s hands stilled mid-knot. Her gaze flicked to the picture, then to their faces. “That was a long time ago,” she said finally. “I was just a girl. But I remember the talk.”

“What kind of talk?” Gabi asked.

She hesitated, eyes dropping to her work. “Levi was meant to lead with Ben. But his heart… went elsewhere. Even toward things that did not belong to him.”

Her gaze lifted, sharp and measuring. “You know the name. Clarissa.”

Gabi’s grip on the photograph tightened. Their lola.

“She was close to them both,” Anding went on. “Closer than she should have been. Some say she was always meant for Ben. Others… say she and Levi shared something before that. It drove a crack between the brothers — one that never closed.”

She reached for more twine. “And there were other things. Levi kept company with those who practiced _kulam_, and with people who played at rituals best left alone. Even as a child, I heard enough to know they frightened the elders.”

She tied the knot sharply, as if sealing the conversation. “That’s all you need to know. The dead have their place. Don’t go pulling them from it.”

---

They stepped back into the hallway. Len glanced at the photograph again, then at Kin.

“You and Levi,” she said softly. “There’s something in the way you both hold yourselves. Like you’re standing in two places at once.”

Kin’s brow creased, the pause before his answer just a fraction too long. “I don’t see it.”  
His tone was even, but the hand at his side had curled slightly, thumb rubbing the edge of his stole as if on reflex. He turned toward the sala, shoulders a shade tighter than before, and Gabi caught the flicker in his eyes — recognition, quickly buried.

They stepped back into the hallway. The air felt cooler here, as if the fog had found a way inside. 
Somewhere deeper in the house, a door hinge gave a slow, drawn-out creak — but no footsteps followed.  

From the far end of the corridor, Elia stood half in shadow, her stuffed monkey dangling from one hand. She didn’t speak, only watched them pass, her gaze sliding from Gabi to Kin and then to the photograph in Len’s hand.  

When Gabi offered a small smile, she tilted her head and whispered something he couldn’t catch. Then she turned and padded away toward the sala without a sound.

**Carlos – Before Dusk**

---
  
Carlos had been leaning against the rusted railing outside the billiards hall for nearly an hour, watching the traffic snarl and break on the main road. The air smelled of diesel and fried peanuts. He chewed a toothpick, jaw tight, thinking about the last hand of cards and the bills still stuffed into his back pocket — not enough to cover what he owed.  

A pair of debt collectors he’d worked with earlier passed him on the sidewalk, nodding their chins. He didn’t nod back.

He told himself he was thinking about his next move, but really, the same thought kept circling: Ben’s face, slack and grey, the moment his head hit the stones. He could still feel the rough give of the old man’s shoulder under his hands.

*He would have cast you out anyway.*

The thought slid in without warning, like it had been waiting in the dark just beyond the edge of his mind. Carlos froze, the toothpick turning to pulp between his teeth.

*He was already halfway gone. You only finished it.*

His pulse kicked hard. He glanced around — traffic still streaming, vendors still shouting — but the sound seemed thinner now, like he was under water.

*It was yours to take. The rest will be yours too.*

Something cold coiled at the base of his skull. Carlos rubbed the back of his neck, but the chill spread down his spine. The sunlight was still there, but the shadows from the building stretched longer than they should have, reaching for his boots.

“You don’t know what you’re talking about,” he muttered under his breath, not sure if he was talking to himself.

The whisper came again, close enough to feel its breath.

*You will.*

The air shifted — a sudden cold gust cutting through the city heat, carrying the smell of damp earth. The same smell from the cave.

Carlos swore and shoved off the railing, heading inside. But the cold stayed with him, curling under his skin like it had found a home.

**Elia - Nightfall**

---

Elia sat cross-legged on the floor of the sala, the stuffed monkey pressed to her chest. Outside, the fog clung to the windows, dulling the sounds of the street until the world felt far away. The only noise came from the faint ticking of the wall clock and the slow creak of the vigil chair when the wind moved through the gaps in the walls.

She kept glancing at Lolo Ben’s body. Tito Kin said he was with Jesus now, but she didn’t understand why he still sat here, watching them all.

A flicker in the corner of her vision made her turn. Through the glass panes, the fog rippled — shapes inside it shifting as though people were moving just out of sight. Then she saw him.

Lolo Ben was standing. Not sitting in the chair, not still and quiet — standing in the doorway of the hall, his shoulders bent, his head tilted too far to one side. His eyes looked wrong. Hollow.

Her gaze slid past him, toward the dark at the edge of the room.  
“It’s cold… like the cave,” she whispered, though no one had told her about it. “He says it’s waiting.”

“Elia,” he said, except it wasn’t his voice. The sound was layered, cracked, like many voices speaking at once, some whispering, some almost growling. The syllables pulled at her mind, pressing behind her eyes. She clutched her monkey tighter.

The edges of the room bled into shadow. She felt her body go stiff, her breath catch. Lolo Ben’s mouth kept moving, the words no longer ones she understood — twisted, jarring, in a rhythm that made her stomach knot.

A deep black closed in from all sides. She tried to scream, but her voice stuck in her throat. Her eyes rolled upward and the world vanished.

---

The scream tore through the house. High, sharp, and gone in an instant — but enough to make Kin drop what he was doing and run.

He burst into the sala. Elia lay on the floor, her small body rigid, lips moving soundlessly, eyes rolled back so only the whites showed.

For a heartbeat, he thought he saw something — a shadow peeling away from the vigil chair, sliding toward the far corner before dissolving into nothing.

“Elia!” He knelt beside her, his hands firm but careful on her shoulders. “In nomine Patris et Filii…” His voice caught as her body slackened suddenly, going limp in his arms.

---

By the time Gabi reached them, Kin was already lifting her from the floor.

“What happened?” he demanded, his voice breaking. He took her gently, checking for injuries. The only mark was a faint bruise blooming at her temple.

“She needs a doctor,” Gabi said, already moving toward the door. “It could be a seizure, or a faint — anything.”

Kin stood where he was, eyes locked on the vigil chair. “It wasn’t a faint.”

Gabi shook his head, clutching Elia close. “We don’t know that.” But even as he said it, he felt the prickle of cold along the back of his neck — the same unease he’d felt since the moment he’d come home.

Kin didn’t answer. He stood rooted in the sala, watching as Gabi carried Elia out into the fog. Somewhere beyond the glass, a figure shifted and was gone — no footsteps, no sound. The air felt heavier, as if the house itself were holding its breath. He tightened his grip on the rosary at his belt. Whatever had lingered at the edges was no longer content to watch. It had chosen.
