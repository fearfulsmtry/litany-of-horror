**Part II - In The Dark, They Call**

_“The wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray from birth, speaking lies.”_ — Psalm 58:3

---

The backyard hummed with life.  
Children shrieked, darting between chairs. Smoke curled thick from the grill where Tonio stood, tongs in hand, sweat beading down his neck. Pork skewers hissed as fat dripped, flames snapping at the edges. Beside them, chicken inasal glistened, brushed with orange oil, the scent sharp and sweet.

Chel sat at the long table among Jacob’s relatives. Women laughed around her, passing babies from lap to lap. The table sagged with food: a clay pot of adobo, dark and glossy; a heaped platter of pancit tangled with shrimp; lumpia stacked in golden rows; bowls of halo-halo sweating under shaved ice, syrup running bright at the edges. Plates clattered as hands reached and passed. Every dish steaming, abundant.

Chel smiled when eyes turned to her, but she herself felt hollow. Each cry and laugh landed heavy. She pressed her hands together beneath the table, nails marking skin.

Across the yard Jacob stood stiff, stubby in hand, shirt damp with sweat. He laughed when the men laughed, but always half a beat too late. His eyes kept darting to the gate, as though measuring distance.

Tonio shouted from the grill, voice booming. “Jakey boy! You need to eat more, at this rate you’ll never get Chel pregnant!” The men roared with laughter, a typical jab from his kuya. Jacob’s smile tightened. He raised his bottle in answer, lips pressed thin.

Cecilia— their mother, streaked grey hair pulled neatly back, eyes kind but firm—swept past carrying a platter loaded with skewers. She held it out to him. “Anak, kain na.”

Jacob plucked one from the pile, nodding. “Thanks, Ma.” He held it, but didn’t bite. Oil slicked his knuckles. He wiped it quickly on a napkin, gaze already sliding away.

Chel’s younger sister Mai dropped into the chair beside her, hair tied back, nursing scrubs still under her jacket. She leaned close, her voice soft. “Ate, are you alright?”

Chel’s throat tightened. She forced a smile. “I’m fine.”

Mai reached for her hand under the table, gave it a squeeze, then let go before anyone noticed. “All this waiting must be torture, let's head inside later, have some tea,” she whispered. Her eyes lingered on Chel’s face, worried but gentle.

At the other end of the table a baby shrieked with delight, flinging rice across the cloth. The women roared with laughter. Chel’s smile faltered. Her vision blurred. She dabbed her eyes quickly with a napkin, pretending it was the smoke.

Tonio lifted a skewer high from the grill, meat charred and dripping. “Perfect!” he called. The men approved. Jacob forced another laugh, bottle lifted in salute.

Chel’s gaze drifted past the table, past the bright toys scattered on the grass. She fixed her eyes on the paling fence, willing herself a measure of composure.

The backyard swelled with noise. Life in abundance.

Plates were stacked, bowls scraped clean, the smell of soy and vinegar still clinging to the air. The grill had cooled to glowing coals, smoke drifting thin into the night. Children clustered near, drowsy but restless, tugging at skirts and sleeves.

Lola Luding sat on a low chair, shawl pulled close despite the heat. She tapped her cane against the bricks, drawing eyes to her. Her voice was low, lilting, almost playful.

“In the province, we knew the dark was never empty. There were the _aswang_ who flew at night, looking for blood. The _duwende_ hiding under trees, cursing those who mocked them. And the _tikbalang_—horse-headed, tall as the sky—leading travellers in circles.”

The children giggled, wide-eyed. One boy flapped his arms like wings. The adults chuckled, shaking their heads.

But Lola leaned forward, her tone sharpening. “And the worst… the **_tiyanak_**.”

The laughter died down. Even the cicadas seemed to hush.

“They are babies abandoned, left to die. But they come back. Crying. Hungry.” She let the words hang, her voice rasping. “Not truly babies. Demons wearing their faces. They wait in the dark, calling for a mother… calling _Mama_.”

One child whimpered, hiding her face against an aunt’s shoulder. A cousin laughed nervously. “Lola, you’ll scare them.”

Lola’s eyes stayed fixed on the glowing coals. “Better to fear than forget.”

Chel’s hand tightened around her empty fork, though her plate was long cleared. The word _hungry_ caught in her chest. _Calling for a mother._ A faint shiver ran through her. She looked down quickly, brushing her hair back as if smoke had stung her eyes.

Across the yard Jacob stood with the men, stubby slack in his hand, gaze down on the grass. He hadn’t laughed since Tonio’s last jab.

Cecilia shifted closer, her voice warm but steady. “Not a curse. Children are a blessing. Like all my beautiful apos,” addressing the children.

Lola spoke again, softer now, though her eyes glinted. “And there are those who prey on the innocent. The _mangkukulam_. They whisper to desperate mothers, offer them remedies, charms. But what they really seek is the life inside the womb… taken for their dark rituals.”

The coals hissed softly, smoke lifting thin and gray.

Chel drew a slow breath, blinking hard. She told herself it was nothing. Just stories. Just smoke.

But the word lingered as she sat among them, thin and sharp as glass:

_Anak._

The noise outside softened. The grill hissed low, its smoke nearly gone. Children squealed in the yard, cousins chasing them in the dark.

Chel slipped into the kitchen, stacking plates into the sink. The water ran warm, suds foaming around her wrists. She leaned forward, eyes catching her reflection in the microwave glass — pale, hollow, ringed with shadow. She shut it quickly, unsettled.

Through the open doorway came voices. Deeper now, the men’s laughter quieter, words easier to catch.

Eduardo’s tone carried, steady as stone. “Tonio’s doing well. Kids growing so fast. You saw Liza tonight—already in school.”

Jacob’s voice followed, lighter than it should have been. “Yeah. She’s getting big.”

Silence stretched, only the scrape of a chair. Then Eduardo again, blunt, direct: “So, Jacob… when will it be your turn?”

Chel froze, hands still in the water.

No answer. The refrigerator hummed, the yard buzzed faint outside, but Jacob said nothing.

Eduardo cleared his throat. “You’re not getting younger, hijo. A man builds for the next generation. Otherwise, what’s it all for?”

Chel’s breath tightened. She wanted to step back into the yard, to say something, anything. Instead she stayed hidden, fingers gripping the plate beneath the suds.

At last Jacob spoke, voice clipped. “We’re… working on it, Pa.”

Eduardo grunted. “Work harder.” A chair scraped again. Footsteps moved away.

Chel shut the tap. Water dripped from her hands into the silence.

The laughter outside swelled again, children shrieking, Tonio calling for more beer.

Chel pressed her wet hands flat on the counter. Eduardo’s words still hung in the air, sharp as a blade:

_When will it be your turn?_

The townhouse was quiet again. The noise of the BBQ still clung to Jacob’s ears — laughter, shrieking children, his father’s voice like stone. Here only silence waited.

He peeled off his shirt, dropped it on the chair, and stepped into the bathroom. The tiles were cool, faintly damp underfoot. He twisted the tap, rinsed his mouth, toothbrush foaming as he scrubbed hard, jaw tight.

Movement flickered in the mirror.

Jacob froze, eyes fixed on the glass.

A child had darted across the reflection — small, the size of a toddler, the head suspiciously larger than normal. The glimpse was quick, shadow skittering from one side to the other, gone before he could blink.

He spun. The bathroom was empty. Only the faint hum of the fan.

His breath rasped. He gripped the sink with wet knuckles, eyes darting back to the mirror. Only himself now, chest rising and falling, toothbrush dripping foam.

He shook his head, muttered under his breath, spat into the sink. The foam swirled down the drain.

Then he looked down.

Across the tiles — footprints. Tiny. Wet. Leading from the doorway toward him. Toes splayed wide, water trailing across the grout.

Jacob staggered back, nearly slipping. He crouched low, staring. The nearest print glistened under the light, fresh as if pressed seconds ago.

He reached out with trembling fingers, swiped his palm across the tile. Nothing. Dry.

He blinked. The prints were already fading, one by one, vanishing into the sheen of the floor.

From the bedroom Chel’s voice drifted, muffled, drowsy. “Jacob? You coming?”

His throat was dry. “Yeah,” he answered too quick. “Just a minute.”

He shut the light, stepped out, heart hammering. Behind him the bathroom lay dark, mirror blank, tiles clean.

The townhouse slept in silence.

Chel stirred, heart pounding. She had been dreaming again, the same recurring dream - ash crumbling in her arms, a baby dissolving to dust, her palms blackened. She woke with a gasp, clutching the sheets.

The room was dark, the hum of the fridge below faint through the floorboards. Beside her Jacob lay turned to the wall, his breath steady.

Chel’s eyes adjusted slowly. Shapes in the dark. The wardrobe. The chair. The pale gleam of the window.

Then she felt it.

A weight in the air. Thick. Pressing. The sense that she was not alone.

She turned her head, breath shallow.

At the edge of the bed crouched a figure.

Small. Toddler-sized. Limbs bent wrong, too long at the joints. Its head sagged forward, swollen, face hidden in shadow.

Chel’s whole body locked. She clamped a hand over her mouth, afraid to scream. Unsure if she could if she tried.

The thing did not move at first. It only crouched, still as stone, watching.

The silence pressed heavier. Her breath stuttered shallow, each inhale a gasp she tried to smother against her hand. She tried to blink but couldn’t look away.

Then, with a sudden twitch, its head jerked upward. Eyes glimmered faint in the dark, wide and milky.

Chel pressed back into Jacob, but he did not stir.

The shadow shifted at last. Its limbs bent and scuttled low, insect-like, joints clicking as it slid across the floor. It darted under the bed, vanishing with a scrape against the boards.

Chel lay frozen with terror. Her eyes locked to the edge of the bed, unblinking.

The silence that followed was worse than the sound. She could not breathe, could not call Jacob’s name.

Every muscle in her body trembled. She knew it was still there. Waiting beneath them.

The townhouse held its breath.
