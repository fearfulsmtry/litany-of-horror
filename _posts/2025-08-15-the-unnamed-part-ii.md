**Part II - The Weight of Silence**

_“They turned their faces away, and the house kept its vigil.”_

---

The fog had thinned again by the following morning, but the hush from the vigil still clung to the house.

Gabi stepped out of the house before anyone else had stirred, drawn by the smell of wet pine and the hush that always followed the final “Amen.” The air still held the scent of wax and wilted flowers. Mist moved between the trees like something alive.

He expected solitude.

But there she was.

Len knelt beside the vigil chair, arranging blossoms in the wooden bowl. She worked slowly, her back straight, her movements quiet. Her long hair was tied loosely with a thin red ribbon, and her dress, though simple, carried the gentle grace of someone who had stopped trying to impress the world.

She hadn’t seen him yet.

He stood a moment longer, unsure what to say, or if he should say anything at all. He hadn’t seen her in the light in ten years. She looked older, of course, but not worn. If anything, the years had made her more composed. There was strength in the stillness of her hands.

She looked up.

Their eyes met.

For a moment, the years collapsed. Gabi felt everything at once: the night he left, the messages he never sent, the ache that had followed him across oceans.

She rose, brushing her hands on her skirt.

“Good morning,” she said, voice soft but clear.

He managed a nod. “I didn’t know you’d be here.”

She glanced at the flowers. “I came early. Kin said you might be up.”

He took a few steps forward, but stopped short of the chair. “I thought you’d left Baguio by now.”

Her gaze dropped to the blossoms. “I almost did. But then Tatay fell. Mama couldn’t manage alone.”

She looked back up at him. “I stayed.”

Gabi swallowed.

That was who she was. Always steady. Always choosing to face trouble head on when things got hard.

“I’m sorry,” he said quietly. “For leaving the way I did.”

Her expression shifted, not angry, not cold. Just honest.

“You didn’t just leave, Gabi. You disappeared.”  
She folded her arms, not defensive, just holding herself. “I kept waiting for something. Even a message. But nothing came.”

“I wrote. I just…” he exhaled. “I thought you’d moved on. I didn’t want to...”

“Hurt me?” she said. “Again?”

The words weren’t sharp. But they cut all the same.

He nodded.

They stood in silence. The fog stirred between them.

“I’m not here to reopen anything,” she said after a moment. “Just… felt like I should come. Lolo Ben always said flowers make grief breathe easier.”

Gabi managed a faint smile. “You remembered that.”

“I remember a lot of things,” she said.

She turned back to the chair and adjusted one of the blossoms. Her hand lingered a moment on the armrest, just beside Lolo Ben’s still hand.

“I’ll go,” she said. “Let you have a quiet morning.”

“You don’t have to.”

She didn’t answer that. Just nodded, turned, and walked slowly toward the garden path.

Gabi watched until the mist swallowed her.

He sat beside the vigil, eyes on the face that once held answers.  How he wished he could ask.  
But Lolo Ben said nothing.  The silence said too much.

**Fr. Kin – Late Morning**

---

The house was quieter now.

The cousins had drifted outside. Someone was cooking, Kin could smell garlic and oil. The radio played faintly in the kitchen, something old and staticky. But here in the sala, where the vigil chair sat beneath a hanging cross, the air felt different.

Still.

Too still.

Fr. Kin entered with a slow step. He carried a small brass candleholder, the kind used during bedside blessings. He’d intended to replace one of the vigil lights that had gone out overnight. But he paused when he saw her.

Elia was sitting cross-legged on the floor, not playing, not reading. Just… watching.

She had a piece of paper in her lap and a pencil in hand. Her stuffed monkey sat beside her, its head lolling toward the vigil chair.

Kin approached gently.

“What are you drawing, Elia?”

She held it up without looking at him.

It was crude, childlike—but clear. The chair, the man, the blanket, the flowers. But one thing stood out.

The eyes were open.

Two dark pencil ovals where Lolo Ben’s closed lids should have been. Not wild, not monstrous—just… looking.

“He opened them this morning,” Elia said matter-of-factly. “Only for a second.”

Kin crouched beside her, resting his free hand on his knee.

“Are you sure?”

She nodded, still not looking away. “He was facing that way before.” She pointed. “Now he’s looking here.”

Kin turned.

Lolo Ben’s corpse sat exactly as it had—but Kin had seen enough wakes to recognize **what shouldn’t change**. The angle of the neck. The tilt of the head.

Yesterday, he had been facing the chapel doors.

Now he looked toward the stairs.

Kin stood. Slowly. Walked to the chair.

He said nothing for a long while. Just stood with the candle in one hand, the other brushing his stole where it hung over his shoulder.

“Elia,” he said gently, “why were you watching him so closely?”

“Because he watches me back.”

A candle sputtered just then, as if startled.

The words weren’t playful. They weren’t afraid, either.

Kin swallowed.

He crouched again, this time before the chair. The body was cool, stiff. The scent of death had begun to bloom faintly beneath the layers of cologne and herbs. But the posture was wrong. Just subtly enough to make doubt impossible.

He rose, lit the replacement candle, and set it in place.

Then he dipped two fingers into the vial of holy water at his waist and traced a cross in the air.

_“Defende nos in proelio…”_ he murmured.

Protect us in battle.

Elia watched him from the floor, pencil still in her fingers.

“Is he okay?” she asked softly.

Kin didn’t answer.

He only looked up at the crucifix on the wall.

Then at the corpse.

Then back at the girl.

“I don’t know yet,” he said.

---

**Gabi – Late Morning**

---

Gabi walked to clear his head.

He told no one, just slipped out the back gate and followed the slope past the guava trees. The fog had begun to return in thin fingers across the ridges. Not as heavy as before, but enough to blur the edges of the hills into something half-remembered. His boots thudded dully against the moist earth.

He needed the air.

The house had felt too full of memory, of unanswered questions. Of Len’s voice still echoing in his chest.

He took the old path behind the property wall. As a boy, he and Kin had walked it dozens of times. It led nowhere in particular—just curved along a shallow ravine and disappeared into brush. The trees here were thinner, bent inward by years of wind. The air was colder.

That’s when he saw them again.

He stopped without thinking, heart snagging in his throat.

Three figures, distant and half-obscured by mist, drifting slowly across the trail ahead.

Same as before: barefoot, thin, their gait too smooth. Almost gliding. Their heads were bowed—or missing. It was hard to tell. The fog blurred the top halves of their forms, like unfinished sketches. But the shoulders, the backs, the bare feet, those were too detailed to dismiss.

They moved silently.

Not toward him. Not away. Just… across.

From nowhere to nowhere.

Gabi ducked instinctively behind a narra tree, breath held.

He wasn’t close enough to make out faces. But the sense of **wrongness** crept over his skin like static. He felt watched, even though they never turned.

Then... one of them paused.

Just for a second. A small hitch in its step.

And though it had no face, Gabi felt it was **looking right at him**.

He blinked. The fog shifted.

They were gone.

Nothing but branches swaying and the sound of distant water below.

He stood there, frozen, blood pounding in his ears.

_What did I just see?_  
He shook it off, hard. _Lack of sleep. Too much grief. That’s all._

He retraced his steps toward the house.

---

As he rounded the east side, past the faded prayer grotto and the old rain barrels, he passed a window—half open, obscured by lace curtains yellowed with time.

He wasn’t trying to eavesdrop.

But the voices inside stopped him cold.

Tita Anding’s, low and urgent:

> “You never should have gone there Carlos. What did you think would happen?”

Carlos, slurring but sharp:

> “I didn’t have a choice”

A pause. Something slammed—maybe a cabinet.

Then Carlos again, quieter:

> “He’s already asking questions.”

Anding’s voice, colder now:

> “Then keep your mouth shut. If this gets out—”

The rest was lost in a swell of wind.

Gabi backed away, careful not to let the gravel crunch beneath his steps.

When he returned to the sala, the candles were still burning beside Lolo Ben.

The chair hadn’t moved.

But something else had shifted—and Gabi couldn’t name it yet.

---

**Fr. Kin – Nightfall**

---

The house had settled into silence.

Fr. Kin moved through it barefoot, cassock loosened at the neck, rosary coiled in his right hand. He passed sleeping cousins curled in corners, the soft breath of children, the creak of settling beams. The vigil candles still flickered in the sala.

He entered alone.

He did not bring incense. He did not announce himself with liturgy.

He simply sat—between the second and third step of the staircase, the same spot where he used to say night prayers as a teenager. Lolo Ben had caught him there once, murmuring the Memorare under his breath, and said nothing—only rested a hand on his shoulder before walking away.

That memory felt far now. Like something folded in tissue.

He pressed thumb to bead.  
His mind should’ve been on the Mysteries.

But for a moment—just a moment—his thoughts drifted elsewhere.

To the way Len had looked that morning, kneeling beside the flowers.  
How grace had settled on her.  
How time had only deepened her presence.

He closed his eyes, ashamed of the softness in him.

_Not now._

He exhaled, then began Compline:  
_“You will not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day…”_  
_“For he will command his angels concerning you, to guard you in all your ways…”_

The fog outside pressed against the windows. There was no wind, but the air inside the sala felt… disturbed. Not heavy. Not cold. Just subtly rearranged.

He glanced at the crucifix on the far wall.

It was tilted.

Not much—five, maybe ten degrees off its true axis. But Kin knew how carefully it had been centered. He’d adjusted it himself just yesterday.

He stood, quietly. Approached it.

The nail in the wall had not shifted.

But the crucifix had.

He righted it gently, lips forming the start of the **St. Michael Prayer**, almost instinctively.

_“Sancte Michael Archangele, defende nos in proelio…”_

Something moved behind him.

He turned sharply. No one there.

The candles beside the vigil chair flickered—not out, not high—just wrong. Like the flame itself had flinched.

He stepped closer.

Lolo Ben’s face looked the same. The hands still folded. The barong still clean.

But the head…

It had tilted further. No one had touched him. Kin was sure of it. He had taken mental note of the posture each night, praying beside him.

Now the chin was lower. As if… listening.

A sound behind him—a soft shuffle.

He turned again. Still nothing.

His breath had grown short. He unfastened his stole and pressed it to his chest, saying the rest of the St. Michael prayer more quickly now, under his breath, eyes scanning the corners of the room.

Then—_snap_.

One of the candles cracked in its holder, a thin thread of smoke spiraling up.

That did it.

Kin turned back toward the stairs, took two steps, then stopped himself.

He faced the vigil once more, steeled his voice.

“Whatever walks here,” he whispered, “you have no claim on this place.”

He dipped his fingers in holy water and cast it toward the chair.

Nothing dramatic happened.

But the air lightened. Slightly. Enough for him to breathe again.

He left without turning his back.

That night, he lay on the bamboo cot in the study, fully clothed, crucifix in hand.

And did not sleep.

---

The sun broke through the mist that morning, lighting up the compound in pale gold. For the first time in days, the fog lifted high enough to see the mountains beyond the ridge.

Gabi sat on the garden bench near the prayer grotto, a chipped mug of coffee steaming in his hands. The air was cold enough to bite the fingertips, warm enough to make the breath rise gently.

Kin joined him without a word, another mug in hand.

They sat in silence for a while, watching the light move over the damp grass. A rooster crowed somewhere behind the house. A child’s laugh echoed from inside.

It felt like a memory.

“Do you remember that time we tried to build a dam in the ravine?” Kin asked, finally breaking the quiet.

Gabi chuckled. “We used banana leaves and old sandals.”

“And almost flooded the backyard.”

“Lolo made us drain it with our hands. Took hours.”

Kin smiled. “We cried. Said it was child labor.”

They both laughed, soft and short.

Then Gabi’s smile faded.

“I still dream about this place sometimes,” he said. “Even when I was out in the Pilbara, boots full of red dust, the sun hammering down… sometimes I’d wake up thinking I was here. Hearing the wind in the stairs.”

Kin glanced at him. “Do you miss it?”

Gabi didn’t answer right away.

“I miss what it used to be. Before the cracks.”

A long pause.

“You mean Carlos,” Kin said.

Gabi nodded. “And what I saw yesterday. In the hills. I don’t know what it was.”

Kin studied him for a moment. “Describe it.”

Gabi shook his head. “It was far. Three figures. Pale. Couldn't see their faces. They didn’t walk… not normally. I don’t know. It felt… cold.”

Kin’s gaze drifted past the trees, toward the curve of the road vanishing into the fog. “This place has seen… losses. Years back, a jeepney went over the ridge. Everyone died. Not all were found whole.” He hesitated. “Some say the ones left unfinished still walk until they’re named again.”

Gabi let out a short, incredulous breath. “You’re telling me I saw ghosts from a traffic accident  years ago?” He smirked, but there was no humor in it. “Kin, I’ve seen plenty of cold things that weren’t spirits.”

“I saw something too,” Kin said. “Last night. In the sala.”

Gabi turned to him.

“The crucifix was tilted. One of the candles cracked. The air…” He hesitated. “It felt like something unseen was watching. Waiting. The chair turned.”

“You think it’s a haunting?” Gabi asked. “Some kind of… echo?”

Kin stirred his coffee, eyes on the dark swirl. “I don't know. Maybe there's something more going on that isn't just family tension.”

Gabi frowned. “Foul play?”

Kin hesitated. “Not exactly.” He set the cup down.

Gabi looked away, jaw tightening.

“I heard Tita Anding arguing with Carlos,” he said. “They were talking about touching something. About someone suspecting. That’s not a ghost. Sounds more like guilt.”

Kin’s gaze drifted toward the fog. “Sometimes guilt draws its own company.”

Gabi gave a short, skeptical laugh. “I’m not ready to jump to ghosts. Not without proof.”

“I’m not asking you to,” Kin said, his tone quiet but insistent. “Just… don’t rule out what you can’t see.”

Another silence settled between them.

A bird landed on the stone edge of the grotto, then flew off again.

“I missed this,” Gabi said softly. “Sitting with you. Before everything got complicated.”

Kin smiled, sad and warm. “It’s still simple, Gabi. You just need to believe that it is.”

They sat a while longer. The fog didn’t return that morning.

---

Evening settled slowly.

The sun slipped behind the mountains, turning the sky the color of rust and old blood. A breeze moved through the compound, light and dry, tugging gently at the edges of old tarpaulins and drying laundry.

Gabi found her near the side altar in the chapel yard, kneeling beside a flat tin basin of cut flowers. She was fixing the new arrangements for the next round of prayers—removing wilted petals, snipping stems clean with a small pair of shears.

She didn’t look up when he approached, but she didn’t leave either.

He sat beside her, cross-legged on the cracked cement, arms resting loosely on his knees. For a long time, neither of them spoke. The sound of the shears kept time.

“Need help?” he asked, eventually.

She handed him a stalk of sampaguita without looking.  
“Pull off the browning buds. Not the green ones.”

He nodded and got to work.

They stayed that way for a while—silent, side by side, surrounded by the scent of cut flowers and the distant sound of children playing.

Then Gabi said, quietly, “I’m sorry.”

She didn’t stop working, but her hands slowed.

“For what?”

“For leaving without saying goodbye. For never writing. For thinking it would hurt less to forget.”

Len set the shears down gently.

“You don’t need to say this,” she said.

“I do.”

She finally looked at him.

“I thought you’d moved on,” he said. “New city. New life. I didn’t want to interrupt it.”

She smiled, faintly. Not bitter.

“I did move on. Just not far.”

He looked at her hands. One still held the flower stalk. The other rested on her knee.

“I’m not asking for anything,” he said, his thumb worrying at the stem until a petal tore “Just… I don’t want to disappear again.”

Len was quiet for a moment, then nodded once.

“Then don’t.”

They worked in silence again after that. It wasn’t peace. Not yet. But it was something like return.

As they stood to bring the flowers inside, Gabi glanced at the window to the sala.

The chair was still there.  
Lolo Ben, still as ever.  
Candles flickering in the deepening dark.
