**Part I - What We Bury**

_“He came again to his own, and the silence received him.”_

---

The fog thickened as the road climbed into Baguio City, high in the Cordillera mountains of the Philippines.

Gabriel Sagayo leaned forward slightly in the driver’s seat, eyes narrowed behind his glasses. The rental van’s headlights cast long cones of pale light through the mist, but it was like driving through breath—every beam swallowed before it could land.

Baguio hadn't changed. Not really. The roads still wound like veins across the mountainside, the air still carried the scent of pine and diesel, and the fog still came without warning. But it pressed on him differently now, like the city knew he had stayed away too long.

He rubbed his eyes.

Jetlag. Not enough sleep. A week of restless nights in transit from Perth, rehearsing what to say at a wake where the body had already gone cold.

And yet.

Up ahead—something moved.

A figure on the side of the road. Human, maybe. Too slender for a man, too still to be safe. At first, he thought it was a local walking the shoulder, wrapped in a blanket against the cold.

But then he saw it.

The feet didn’t touch the ground.

The shape hovered just above the asphalt, gliding rather than stepping, head bowed, arms limp at its sides. The fog bent around it.

Gabi hit the brakes. The van juddered. The figure didn’t turn.

And then—just as quickly—it was gone.

He sat there, knuckles white on the wheel, the engine idling.

A trick of the fog. A sleep-deprived mind. That was all.

He exhaled and kept driving.

---

By the time he reached the family compound, the sun was little more than a pale smudge behind the mist. The gate was open. A wooden sign above it read **SAGAYO**, the paint flaking, the letters half-eaten by rain.

The house was older than he remembered. Of course it was. But it had also… sagged. As though time had pressed it down like a palm on a shoulder. The windows were shut. No music, no voices.

Only fog curling through the gaps in the eaves.

He parked beneath the molave tree, grabbed his bag, and approached the front door.

It opened before he could knock.

Tita Anding stood there, proud as ever, her chin lifted like a sentinel. Her hair had gone fully silver, coiled tight in a bun. She wore a baro’t saya with a faded rosary looped three times around one wrist.

Gabi took her hand and pressed it to his forehead.

“Mano po,” he said softly, a sign of respect.

She smiled - brief, but real. “Handsome boy. You took your time.”

Gabi managed a shallow nod. “The fog slowed me.”

“The fog always slows things.” Her voice softened. “Welcome home, anak. Come in.”

---

The house smelled like vinegar, wood polish, and old prayers.

And something else.

He stepped inside and felt the floor dip beneath his feet—just slightly, just enough to notice. The walls were dark with smoke-stained icons. A statue of San Lorenzo Ruiz watched him from a shelf.

And in the center of the sala, facing the door—

**Lolo Ben**.

Still in the chair.

He wore a barong, hands folded across his stomach, rosary threaded between his fingers. A handwoven burial blanket—faint reds and earth tones, the kind passed down through generations—was folded across his lap. His face had been freshly shaved, his silver hair combed neatly back, the final acts of devotion from hands that loved him. The vigil chair had been propped with cushions, but something in the stillness pressed too close, like the air hadn’t settled right.

The old man’s body sat upright, as though waiting to be spoken to.

Gabi froze.

No embalming. No casket. Just the corpse. The chair. The stillness.

“This is how we do it, anak,” Tita Anding said beside him. “Nine nights of prayer, the old way. He will be buried on the tenth.”

“The Igorot ways,” Gabi murmured. “Like Sagada.”

Anding nodded once. “We remember the old ways here. Your Lolo would have wanted it.”

Gabi took a step forward.

The corpse’s skin was dry. Pale. But the mouth…

The corners of the lips had lifted. Barely. Like something halfway between a smile and a smirk. Gabi leaned in slightly.

There, at the base of the neck—a bruise?

No. Not quite.

A mark. Faint. Dark and round, like ink pressed into skin, then smudged.

He blinked.

When he looked again, it was gone.

---

He stepped back, heart beating faster than he wanted to admit.

“He looks…” Gabi began.

“He looks at peace,” Anding said firmly.

But he didn’t.

Not to Gabi.

The eyes were closed, yes. The limbs still. But there was tension in the jaw, a tightness to the hands beneath the rosary beads. And that chair—it felt like it held more than just the weight of a body.

As though it, too, remembered something it wished it could forget.

---

“Your cousin’s at the chapel,” Anding said. “Kin. He’s been leading the prayers.”

“I’ll greet him later.”

She raised an eyebrow but said nothing.

Then: “There’s someone else who’s been waiting to see you.”

From the hallway, a small shape emerged.

A girl—maybe eight years old. Hair to her shoulders, a small ribbon in one braid. She stared at Gabi without blinking, her arms around a ragged stuffed monkey.

“Elia,” Anding said. “Say hello to your kuya.”

The girl tilted her head.

“You were in the fog,” she said.

Gabi’s throat dried. “What?”

She pointed toward the window.

“You were driving. The man behind you didn’t follow you all the way.”

Anding’s smile didn’t reach her eyes. “She says strange things. Ikaw talagi, Ija.”

Gabi crouched a little to meet her gaze, the corner of his mouth lifting despite the chill her words left. “You’ve got sharp eyes, balong,” he said, giving her shoulder a light squeeze before straightening.

But Elia was already looking past him — at the chair.

---

Gabi found Kin outside, behind the chapel. Fr. Joaquin Sagayo now, but still Kin to him. Always Kin.

He was standing alone under the pine trees, collar loosened, cigarette in one hand, a prayerbook in the other. He hadn’t lit the cigarette.

He just held it.

When he heard footsteps on gravel, he turned—and for a moment, his whole face softened.

“Gabi.”

“Kin.”

They crossed the distance in three strides and embraced—brief, firm, but real.

The last time the cousins had stood face to face was ten years ago. Kin had just entered seminary. Gabi had just booked a one-way flight to Perth.

Now, they stood under the same trees where they used to climb as boys. Where they used to argue about saints and science and girls, half-joking and half-serious.

Now one of them wore black.

The other wore guilt.

“You look tired,” Kin said.

“You look holy,” Gabi replied.

Kin snorted. “I still swear when I stub my toe. Don’t be fooled.”

They sat on the stone ledge behind the chapel. The fog was thinner here, like even it respected the place.

After a pause, Gabi said, “Lolo doesn’t look right.”

Kin didn’t look at him. “He’s been gone four days.”

“I don’t mean the decay. There’s something else.”

A long silence.

Kin finally exhaled through his nose.

“You always had that mind—connecting things.”

“It’s not imagination.”

“I didn’t say it was.”

“Then you’ve noticed it too.”

“I’ve noticed grief. And fatigue. And anxiety creeping in where silence used to sit. But that’s all.”

Gabi frowned. “You’re sure?”

Kin gave him a sidelong glance. “No. But it's not time for suspicion. Its time for mourning.”

That silence again.

Then Kin stood and clapped him on the shoulder. “Come on. The clan’s gathering. If we don’t show up soon, Tita Anding will assume we’re conspiring.”

---

The house had filled up in the short time he’d been away.

Cousins he barely remembered—Junjun, Lisa, Edwin—were seated on low stools, sipping rice coffee and murmuring into their phones. A few distant relatives stood at the edges of the room, offering novena prayers under their breath while subtly eyeing Gabi and Kin.

It was a typical Sagayo affair. Reserved, tightly managed, held up by a scaffolding of ritual and unsaid things.

And then - Carlos.

He emerged from the back hallway like a stormcloud with legs. Burly man, hair unkempt, shirt buttoned wrong, and the smell of gin radiating from his pores.

He spotted Gabi and smirked.

“Well, well. What do we have here.”

Gabi stiffened.

Carlos opened his arms dramatically. “The Australian engineer. Big man from abroad. Too good to visit unless someone’s already cold.”

Kin moved between them before the tension could rise.

“Carlos. You’ve had enough.”

Carlos waved him off. “I’m just welcoming my cousin home. Can’t I be friendly?”

His eyes were red. But there was something else behind them.

Not grief.

**Something oily.**

“Don’t worry,” Carlos said to Gabi, voice lower now. “Lolo always liked you best. The golden boy. The thinker.”

Gabi didn’t reply.

Carlos chuckled and stumbled toward the kitchen, muttering.

Kin exhaled slowly. “He’s been like that since day one.”

“I heard he stopped working.”

“Stopped pretending to, anyway. Anding says he lost money again. Got mixed up with people who don’t forget.”

Gabi watched the doorway Carlos had vanished through.

“Doesn’t feel like guilt,” he said.

Kin gave him a strange look. “What do you mean?”

“I don't know. Something about him feels off.”

---

A soft knock at the open gate.

Then a voice - gentle, respectful.

“Tita Anding? Maari po ba akong pumasok?”

Tita Anding turned, already smiling.

“Len. Of course, hija. Come in.”

The name stuck in his throat. Gabi’s head snapped up.

She stepped into the doorway with her hands clasped politely, a bundle of white santan and camia cradled like an offering. Her blouse was modest, ironed smooth, and she wore a long black skirt that brushed her ankles. A black ribbon held her hair back, the same way she used to wear it when they were young—except now, she was no longer a girl.

She was beautiful.

Not in the way that startled—but in the way that stayed. The kind of beauty that memory never could quite wash out, no matter how long you tried.

She bowed slightly. “I came to pay my respects, po.”

Then her eyes found Gabi.

And time collapsed.

A decade of silence, of distance, of long-buried letters in the back of drawers—all of it surged up at once. He felt it before he understood it: that hollow ache in his chest, the way his mouth opened but nothing came out.

She stepped forward.

“Gabi,” she said softly.

And without waiting, she leaned in and embraced him.

Just long enough to feel real.

Not long enough to fix anything.

He stood frozen for a moment, then let his arms rise, uncertain, around her.

She smelled like sampaguita and old summers. His breath caught.

“Hi,” he managed, finally.

Her voice warmed. “Hi.”

Before he could say more, another voice came from behind him.

“Len?”

She turned, and smiled again—gentler this time.

“Hello, Father.”

He moved forward and hugged her too, this one briefer, warmer. He hadn’t seen her in years either. Not since his ordination.

They stood in silence for a moment, three lives spun around each other like cords pulled tight, then severed.

Kin broke the quiet. “It’s good you came.”

She glanced toward the sala. “Lolo Ben was always kind to me.”

Gabi found his voice again. “He asked about you. Before…”

She looked back at him, and something flickered across her face.

“I’m glad,” she said. “That he remembered.”

She stepped past them, knelt before the corpse, and laid the flowers at his feet. Her hand rested lightly on the chair’s arm, as though she were greeting the old man one last time.

Gabi watched her, chest heavy.

And somewhere deep in the fog of memory, he felt the shape of all he’d lost—and all that might still be left to reclaim.

---

The prayers began at dusk.

Fr. Kin led the novena, his voice hoarse but steady. A few dozen relatives gathered—some kneeling, some sitting cross-legged on the wooden floor, others leaning against the walls with eyes half-shut in exhaustion. The glow of candles flickered against the wooden beams, throwing long shadows that danced like old memories.

Gabi sat near the back, flanked by cousins he barely knew. He couldn’t focus. The words blurred. He kept glancing toward the chair in the sala, where Lolo Ben still sat, then at Len, then at Carlos.

Elia sat on the floor nearby, cradling her stuffed monkey, lips moving along with the prayers. But her eyes remained fixed on the corpse. Watching.

Len hadn’t stayed long after placing the flowers. She’d offered quiet condolences to the elders, bowed her head once more, and slipped out into the fog. Her eyes met Gabi’s as she left. He didn't follow. He wasn’t ready. Not yet.

By the time the final “Amen” was spoken, a heaviness had settled on the house—not just grief, but something older. Thicker. The kind of silence that settles on things left unsaid.

That night, Gabi lay awake longer than he wanted to admit.

And when sleep finally came, it came wrapped in fog.

---

That night, Gabi dreamed of fog.

Not the thick, white mist of the mountain road—but a black fog, low to the ground, clinging to his ankles like fingers. He stood in the middle of the sala, and everything was wrong. The windows were boarded shut. The crucifix above the door was hanging upside down.

And in the chair—

Lolo Ben.

Still seated. Still wearing his barong.

But this time, his eyes were open.

They weren’t clouded with death. They were _urgent_.

Trying to speak.

Gabi stepped closer. “Lolo?”

The old man’s mouth moved—just barely—but no sound came out. His lips trembled. Forming shapes.

A word. Maybe two.

Gabi leaned in, straining to hear.

He couldn’t make them out.

“Say it,” he whispered. “Please.”

Then the corpse’s hand jerked up and grabbed his wrist—ice-cold, but strong.

Gabi shouted.

Everything dissolved.

---

He woke with a gasp, drenched in sweat.

The fan on the ceiling spun lazily. A rooster crowed somewhere in the fog-soaked hills.

It was still dark.

He sat up, heart pounding, breath sharp in his chest. The dream clung to his skin like damp cloth.

A few minutes passed before he could breathe normally.

And then he noticed it.

From the doorway, he could see the sala.

The chair.

**Lolo Ben was still seated.**

But…

His head was tilted differently.

Slightly to the left. Toward the hallway. As if he'd turned to listen for something.

Gabi blinked.

No one else stirred. The house was asleep.

But he didn’t go back to sleep.

---

By morning, the fog had receded—lighter now, a ghost of its night self

Gabi was in the kitchen, cradling a mug of lukewarm coffee when Elia walked in, barefoot and silent.

She went straight to the table and took a banana without asking.

“Did you sleep well?” Gabi asked, his voice still hoarse.

She peeled the banana with one hand.

“Lolo Ben was walking around last night,” she said, like she was talking about the rain.

Gabi froze. “What?”

Elia took a bite and chewed.

“He doesn’t like the chair. He says it remembers too much.”

She didn’t elaborate.

Just walked away, banana in hand.
