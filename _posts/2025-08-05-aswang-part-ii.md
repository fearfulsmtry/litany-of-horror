**Aswang – Part II: Roots of the Rot** 

_"Their root will be as rottenness, and their blossom will go up like dust."_
_(Isaiah 5:24)_

---

The rain came suddenly the next day.

Sheets of it, like God had overturned a basin across the mountains. The road turned to mud. Chickens huddled beneath upturned basins. The village radios fell silent, as if the static knew better than to speak.

Anna sat curled on the rattan bench by the window, cradling a cup of lukewarm salabat. The baby shifted beneath her ribs—restless. Miguel had gone with Lito to fetch some canned goods before the footbridge flooded. She was alone in the house.

Not quite alone.

She stood up after the third knock.

Not at the door. Inside. In the old bedroom.

Three knocks—soft, like fingers on wood. Then silence.

She opened the door slowly. Nothing there.

But the statue of Our Lady of Sorrows on the bedside altar was facing the wrong way.

It had turned.

---

That night, Miguel returned soaked, the umbrella useless against the sheets of rain. As he changed into dry clothes, Anna stood in front of the bookshelf in Lola Biana’s room. She had opened it looking for old letters—and instead found something else.

At the back, beneath a stack of Novenas to Our Lady of Perpetual Help, was a small wooden box.

Inside: a folded linen cloth, stained dark at the edges, and a yellowing photograph.

The cloth wrapped around what looked like… dried blood. Hardened into flakes. Preserved.

The photo showed a much younger Biana, standing beside a small chapel with another woman—shorter, thinner, unsmiling.

Anna turned it over.

In faded pencil: _Belen, first delivery — 1963._

---

She brought the box to Tatay Lito the next morning.

He went still when he saw it.

“I didn’t know she kept this,” he said.

“She wrote nothing about it,” Anna replied.

“She wouldn’t have,” he said. “She thought words made things more real.”

He took the photo. “That was before Belen disappeared. Before she changed.”

Anna watched him carefully. “What do you remember about the night Lola died?”

Lito looked away.

“I remember a scream,” he said. “Just one. I wasn’t far—I was pruning the kalamansi trees.”

“You didn’t see her fall?”

“I saw her body. At the foot of the stairs. Head twisted wrong. No blood. No struggle.”

He hesitated.

“I told everyone she fell. Because I didn’t want to believe the other possibility.”

“What possibility?”

He looked up at her then. His eyes were dry, but darker than before.

“That something evil visited Mama.”

---

That evening, Anna found an envelope tucked beneath the crucifix on the bedroom altar.

It wasn’t old. The ink hadn’t faded. The handwriting was unmistakably Biana’s.

Inside: a single line.

> _“Protect the children, the mothers. Keep them away, she is not what she seems.”_

She instinctively reached for the relic, she had been keeping it with her, felt it kept her safe.

She stood there, in the silent room, clutching it to her chest.

Outside, the rain stopped.

But the dogs did not bark that night.

They _whimpered._

---

The rain broke the next day. Clouds still hung low, but the sun pierced through in slivers, burning steam off the road.

Word reached the house by midmorning: **Aling Riza**—a mother of three, eight months along with her fourth—had gone into labor unexpectedly.

Anna heard it from Tita Nena, who dropped by with dried fish and news. “It was too soon,” she said, shaking her head. “She wasn’t due till next month. The baby was moving yesterday. They say it just… stopped.”

“Where is she now?” Anna asked.

“At Belen’s.”

Tatay Lito, nearby, went very still.

---

They walked past the chapel and followed the narrow trail behind the balete grove, where Belen’s hut stood half-shaded under banana leaves. The house was clean, but always too quiet. No birds. No insects.

From the open window, Anna heard soft moaning. A woman in pain.

And then—another voice.

Not Belen’s.

Young. Controlled. Mimicking comfort without knowing what it meant.

Anna stepped closer, peering into the hut through the slats.

Inside, Aling Riza lay on a woven mat, her knees drawn, sweat soaking her brow. Belen knelt beside her, murmuring softly, rhythmically. And behind her—watching closely, face calm—was a girl.

No more than twenty. Pale. Eyes too still. Hair tucked neatly in a braid that looked like it hadn’t moved all morning. She held a basin of steaming herbs. Not once did she blink.

Anna felt her stomach knot.

“She’s new,” she whispered.

Lito was beside her. “No,” he said. “She’s not.”

---

Mira Santos had lived in the village for as long as anyone could remember—but rarely seen. Orphaned young. Raised by Belen. Some said she was mute as a child. Others said she never cried, even as a baby.

The other children avoided her.

They said she once followed a boy home after dark, smiling the whole way, not saying a word. They said she offered flowers to a statue that wasn’t a saint.

Anna had never met her. But as she watched now, something struck her—the way Mira moved. Controlled, like imitation. Like she had studied care, and could perform it.

But it never reached her eyes.

---

Hours later, word spread again.

The child was stillborn.

And Aling Riza had not woken.

“She bled too much,” Belen said to the gathered neighbors. “It was her time.”

Anna stood among them, arms wrapped over her belly.

The wails of Riza’s husband and children carried across the fields—raw, jagged, unbearable.

Mira emerged from the house with the bundle wrapped in white cloth. She didn’t look at anyone. She walked toward the chapel gates, placed the bundle by the altar, and whispered something no one could hear.

Tatay Lito stepped forward, jaw tight.

“We bury them together,” he said.

Mira looked at him for a long moment. Something passed in her expression—something like disdain, but laced with sadness. Or hunger.

Then she turned and walked back toward the hut, bare feet silent on the path.

---

That night, Anna couldn’t sleep.

Miguel’s breathing was slow beside her. The baby shifted once, then stilled.

The room was too quiet.

Then she heard it—
faint, steady breathing that wasn’t hers, and wasn’t Miguel’s.

It came from the corner near the window.

She stayed still, fingers tightening around the reliquary under her pillow.

The breathing drew closer.

A slow exhale brushed the air in front of her face.

Anna shut her eyes and prayed without words.

When she looked again, the corner was empty—
but the curtain swayed, though the window was shut.

---

The funeral for Riza was small.

Too small.

Only three relatives came. The others stayed home, murmuring about debt, about travel, about the rain. But Anna heard something else behind the excuses—**fear**. The kind people clothe in logistics.

Tatay Lito stood at the grave’s edge, lips moving in silent prayer. The priest hadn’t come. The coffin had no weight.

And no one asked to see the child.

Later that day, as Anna hung clothes out back, a neighbor passed by and paused awkwardly at the fence.

“Strange,” she said, glancing at the ground. “Riza said the baby was kicking just two days before.”

Anna nodded slowly.

The woman hesitated. “And… you felt yours move today, yes?”

“Yes.”

A pause.

The neighbor whispered, “Then thank God. Light a candle. And don’t eat anything left at your doorstep.”

Then she walked on.

---

That evening, Miguel stayed outside after dinner, fiddling with the bamboo gate. It squeaked too easily; he wanted to reinforce it, maybe string something across the top.

Anna watched him from the window—then noticed she wasn’t alone.

Across the narrow road, in the shadow of the trees, stood Mira.

She said nothing. Didn’t wave. Just… watched. Barefoot again. A small clay cup cradled in her hands.

Miguel hadn’t noticed.

Anna stepped outside, one hand over her belly. “Can I help you?”

Mira blinked once, then shifted her gaze to Miguel.

“You come out here a lot,” she said. Her voice was quiet but sharp, like a needle pulled through fabric.

Miguel turned, startled. “I like the quiet.”

She tilted her head. “Most people here don’t.”

“Maybe I’m different,” he said.

“You are,” she replied. “You look people in the eyes.”

Anna’s skin prickled.

Mira stepped forward, holding out the cup. “For your husband. To ease the nerves. Belen made it.”

Anna didn’t move to take it.

“I can leave it here,” Mira said, and set it gently on the post. She turned to go, then paused.

Her eyes fixed on Miguel’s hands where they gripped the gate. “Strong hands. Kind hands.”

A beat of silence.

“I hope you fight,” she added, almost like a blessing — or a dare.

Then she walked off, feet making no sound on the stone.

---

Miguel drank none of it.

Anna poured it out behind the house when he wasn’t looking. The next morning, the spot where the tea soaked into the earth was ringed with dead ants.

---

That night, Anna awoke suddenly, heart pounding.

It wasn’t a sound.

It was the stillness.

Even the crickets had stopped.

She sat up and turned toward the window. The moonlight filtered through the slats in pale blue strips. She should have seen trees. Maybe the road. Maybe nothing.

Instead—she saw her.

Riza.

Standing at the edge of the clearing. Head tilted. Eyes dark.

Not moving. Not swaying with the wind.

Just watching.

Anna didn’t scream.

She simply closed the curtain.

Then sat beside the altar and lit a candle from the old matchbook she kept in the drawer.

She held the reliquary to her chest and whispered a prayer she didn’t fully remember.

The flame burned low and steady.

When she checked again ten minutes later, the figure was gone.

But the clothespin she'd left on the line that morning was sitting on the window ledge—**inside** the room.

---

Tatay Lito said little the next day.

But he did open the old wooden drawer beneath the altar and hand Anna a small plastic vial filled with holy water.

“You keep this near the bed,” he said.

“Do you think it’s her?”

He looked at her long and hard.

“No,” he said. “I think whatever took her is starting to look like her.”

Then, almost inaudibly, he added:

> “Your lola would have buried the ground in salt by now.”

---

It was a Sunday when they tried to leave.

The last bag was packed. Miguel had checked the tires. Lito had quietly offered them sandwiches wrapped in banana leaves. No one made a scene. There was no confrontation.

Only clouds.

Thick and unmoving.

Miguel gripped the steering wheel as the van bumped along the gravel path toward the road that would take them back to the city. Anna sat with a pillow against her belly, eyes unfocused.

Neither of them spoke.

But when they reached the main road, they found the way blocked.

The river had risen over the concrete bridge. A churning brown torrent flooded the only route back to town, dragging branches and plastic bags in slow, ugly circles.

Miguel swore under his breath. “They didn’t say anything about flooding.”

Anna stared at the water.

“It wasn’t flooded this morning,” she said.

They waited an hour. Then two. But the current didn’t recede.

Finally, they turned back.

---

Tatay Lito met them at the gate with no surprise.

“I had a feeling,” he said simply. “The river always swells early this time of year.”

Miguel was fuming as he unloaded the bags. “I checked the forecast.”

Lito shrugged. “Forecasts don’t know this place.”

Anna sat on the edge of the bed while Miguel paced.

“We’ll try again tomorrow,” he said. “Or we go the long route south through Malasiqui. It’s rough but passable.”

She nodded but said nothing.

Her hands rested lightly on her belly, but she wasn’t feeling the baby move today. Or maybe she was just too numb to notice.

That night, she sat beside Lito while Miguel fixed the jammed window in their room. The candlelight cast long shadows on the wall, and outside, the frogs sang like a thousand small throats in mourning.

“You think we’re being kept here?” she asked suddenly.

Lito looked at her, then at the statue of Our Lady of Sorrows near the altar.

“I think you came back for more than a funeral.”

She waited.

He added, “I think your lola left things undone. And you’re part of finishing it.”

Anna stared at the candle. “I don’t even know if I believe anymore.”

“You don’t need to believe,” Lito said. “You just need to _ask_.”

She looked up at him.

He smiled faintly. “Even doubt can become prayer, if you let it.”

---

Later, in the dark, she lay curled in bed, back pressed to Miguel’s chest.

“I’m scared,” she whispered.

He wrapped an arm around her. “It’s just a bad trip. We’ll get out tomorrow.”

She shook her head. “Not of the village.”

He was quiet.

“Of… being like her. My mum. Watching everything fall apart and still clinging to hope like it meant something. Praying to a God that didn’t answer.”

Miguel exhaled. “Your mum was strong.”

“She was alone.”

“No,” he said, voice low. “She had you. And… she had faith. That’s not nothing.”

Anna said nothing for a long while.

Finally, she whispered: “Do you pray?”

Miguel was silent.

Then, after a breath, “Not since I was a kid.”

Another pause.

“I used to pray for my dad,” he said. “Before the chemo failed.”

“What happened?”

“I got tired of silence.”

---

Sometime after midnight, Anna awoke with a strange sensation in her legs—cold, like water soaking into her bones.

She sat up.

The floor was dry.

But the window was open.

She was sure she had locked it.

She stepped toward it slowly, heart pounding.

Outside, the moonlight spilled across the trees.

And standing just at the edge of the clearing—

**Riza.**

Not her body. Not quite.

The shape of her.

The eyes didn’t shine. The skin didn’t move with breath.

But it _watched_.

Anna reached back blindly and felt the edge of the bed.

She whispered a prayer—fragmented, unfinished:

“Lord… if You see me… if You see _her_…”

The figure didn’t move.

But the baby kicked—hard, sudden, as if startled.

And the candle on the altar flared.

When Anna looked back out the window…

The figure was gone.

But at the foot of the bed, laid carefully like a gift, was a single baby tooth.

Still wet.

#### **I. Biana — Silang, 1972**

The girl had stopped breathing in the second hour of labor.

Too narrow, Biana knew. The child had turned wrong, shoulder caught against bone. The mother—a girl herself—was barely sixteen, a niece of the bishop.

They had sent a jeep to fetch the priest, not expecting Biana to succeed.

But she did.

She worked in silence, praying with every breath, coaxing life out of blood and bone. Her hands were steady, though her vision blurred from sweat. At one point she whispered the Hail Mary into the girl’s ear—not for pain, but for courage.

The child came out blue.

Biana struck her feet. Rubbed her chest.

And when the cry came—thin and gasping—it sounded like a bird learning to sing.

---

The bishop arrived two hours later. He expected a corpse.

Instead, he found his niece asleep, her child wrapped in woven cloth beside her, breathing.

Biana sat by the door, rinsing her hands in a basin of cool water. She didn’t stand. Didn’t bow. She only nodded at the bishop as he entered, exhausted and empty.

He returned three days later, this time with a small parcel in his hand.

“I should’ve been here,” he said. “But you were.”

He gave her a **first-class relic**—a sliver of bone from **San Lorenzo Ruiz**, the first Filipino saint. It came in a brass reliquary disk, hand-carried from Manila.

“Keep this,” he said. “There may be darker births to come.”

Inside the relic’s wrapping was a handwritten psalm:

> _“He will cover you with His pinions, and under His wings you will find refuge…”_

Biana never displayed it. She didn’t talk about it.  
But she began praying differently after that day—lower, slower, like someone speaking through a locked door and waiting for the knock from the other side.

---

#### **II. Teresa — Perth, 2006**

Anna sat on the edge of the bed, arms crossed, eyes blank.

They hadn’t spoken much since the funeral.

The house felt smaller with her father gone. Quieter, but not in a peaceful way. Like someone had left a door open to a place you couldn’t see.

Teresa knelt to tie Anna’s school shoes. Her fingers fumbled at the laces.

“You don’t have to go,” she said gently.

Anna shrugged. “I’ll just sit in the library.”

Teresa smiled faintly. “That’s very you.”

She stood, walked to the counter, and pulled out Anna’s bag. Tucked inside was a sandwich, a water bottle… and a small **plastic rosary**, the kind given out at novenas.

When Anna noticed it, she frowned. “Why that?”

Teresa hesitated. Then sat beside her.

“Because,” she said softly, “if you ever feel lost…”

She brushed Anna’s hair gently behind her ear.

“…I want Heaven to know where to find you.”

Anna didn’t answer.

But later, when she opened her bag at school and touched the beads, something ached in her chest that wasn’t just grief.

---

#### **III. Present — The Village, Night**

Anna woke before dawn.

She was still sitting upright in bed. Her neck ached. Her hands were clenched around something.

She looked down.

The **relic**.

Still wrapped in Biana’s linen. Still warm.

She didn’t remember reaching for it.

She turned to the window. The moonlight was pale and distant. The salt line still held.

She closed her eyes and whispered:

> “I remember, Mama.”
