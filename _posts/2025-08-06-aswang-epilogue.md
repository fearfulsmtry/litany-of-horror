**Epilogue: The Flame That Remained**

_“I have called you by name. You are mine.”_
_(Isaiah 43:1)_

---

The village opened again within the week.

The rains stopped.

The fog lifted.

The roads, once washed out, dried under the returning sun.

No one asked what had happened to Belen or Mira.  
But some began to return to the chapel.

They found the floors swept.  
Fresh candles in the alcoves.  
An old altar cloth, pressed and clean.

No one knew who had done it.

But they saw, above the small tabernacle, a new item placed behind the wrought-iron grate:

A brass reliquary, wrapped in white linen and bound with red thread.

> The relic of **San Lorenzo Ruiz**.

It sat nestled in a cypress-wood base, beneath a small plaque that read:

> _“For those who did not flee the night.”_

And beside it—always lit—a candle that **never went out**.

---

Three months later, back in Perth, Anna gave birth to a son.

It was a hard labor.

But clean.

And when he cried—loud, immediate, defiant—Anna wept harder than she had in months.

She named him **Lorenzo Miguel**.

Lorenzo, after the martyr whose relic saved her life.  
Miguel, after the man who chose prayer over panic.

---

The baptism was held on a bright spring morning in a quiet parish near the coast.

The priest smiled gently as he poured water over the child’s head.

> “Lorenzo Miguel, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.”

Anna and Miguel stood beside him, fingers interlaced.

Their child cried once.

Then settled.

At the foot of the font stood **Tatay Lito**, dressed in a crisp barong, his bolo blade long left behind.

The priest anointed Lorenzo’s forehead.

And Lito, eyes glistening, stepped forward and placed his hand gently on the boy’s head.

> “I will pray for you every day,” he whispered.  
> “And I will teach you how to watch.”

He was now **ninong**—godfather.

But more than that: **a man redeemed by the fight he chose not to run from.**

---

Outside the church, the bell rang once.

Not loud.

But real.

And in a pew not far from the altar, the light caught the edge of an old rosary—

One that had been forgotten.

But never abandoned.

---

Somewhere far from the village, a woman with a pale scar on her ribs sits on a straw mat, whispering a name no one else remembers.

She does not age.

She does not pray.

But she listens.

In the dark, a child cries—not with pain, but with hunger that isn’t his.

Mira hums a lullaby that Belen once sang. Her hands move over herbs. Over skin. Over silence.

> “They think I died,” she murmurs.  
> “But what she gave me… lives.”

Outside, the chickens do not cluck. The windows do not open.

And no one remembers why their dreams taste of ash.
