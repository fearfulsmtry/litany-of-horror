**Aswang – Part V: Faith Draws the Blade**  

_"There is a time to kill, and a time to heal"_
_(Ecclesiasties 3:3)_

---

The house was quiet in the early dusk. The kind of quiet that felt less like rest and more like **waiting**.

They sat around the table with the last of the rice and fish untouched.

Anna cradled a cup of lukewarm salabat. Miguel was sharpening the machete he’d found in the back shed, the rasp of steel filling the silence. Tatay Lito lit a stick of incense and placed it by the door, whispering a short prayer under his breath.

> _“San Lorenzo, be our shield…”_

Then he turned to them, the candlelight flickering in his eyes.

“We need to talk about what comes next.”

Anna nodded. Her face was drawn, her eyes hollow but alert.

Miguel didn’t look up from the blade. “We wait, right? Hold the line?”

Lito shook his head.

“We can’t keep holding ground forever,” he said. “She’s not just hunting anymore. She’s preparing.”

“For what?” Anna asked.

Lito glanced at her belly.

“For a ritual,” he said. “The final one. The _pasa_ must be rooted in something. That’s why she hasn’t killed us yet. She’s preparing the altar.”

“Here?” Miguel asked.

“Not in this house. But in the village. Near the trees. Near the old hut.” Lito’s voice dropped. “She’s circling. She’s feeding. And when the hour comes, she’ll try to break the barrier and take what she wants.”

Anna’s voice was quiet.

“What if we leave?”

“We’ve tried,” Miguel said. “We’ll end up right back here.”

Lito nodded. “She’s sealed the village. Not physically. Spiritually. The circle won’t open again unless she’s broken.”

A heavy pause settled between them.

Anna looked down at her stomach.

The child stirred. A slow, deliberate shift—like turning toward something.

“I don’t want him to grow up in fear,” she whispered.

Miguel reached across the table, his hand over hers.

“He won’t.”

Anna spoke softly, but with finality.

> “Then we must kill her.”

Miguel finally set down the blade.

There was no argument.

No moral debate.

Just stillness.

Like the stillness before a hammer falls.

---

Anna dreamed that night.

Not of Mira. Not of Belen.

Not of the field with whispering stalks or the shape behind the door.

She dreamed of her grandmother.

---

The candle was nearly out.

It flickered on the old altar in the bedroom, casting long shadows over the rosary beads and the relic she’d hidden too long.

**Fabiana** stood with her hands folded over her stomach. Her hair was tied in a neat bun. Her dress was simple. Clean. The way her own mother taught her to dress when facing the dying.

She wasn’t sure who would die tonight.

Only that one of them must.

---

The knock came softly. Not rushed.  
As if the visitor already knew the door would open.

Fabiana turned the knob and stepped aside.

**Belen** entered.

No veil. No herbs.  
Just a faint smile that did not reach her eyes.

“You summoned me like a priest,” she said.

Fabiana didn’t return the smile. “I summoned you like a midwife. When something dark is crowning, you don’t wait for it to arrive. You prepare.”

---

Belen looked around the room. Her gaze lingered on the crucifix. Then the relic. Then back to Fabiana.

“You were once my teacher,” she said. “Now you speak to me like I’m unclean.”

“I taught you to help mothers bring life into the world,” Fabiana said. “Not to mimic it with death.”

Her voice didn’t rise. But it deepened. Rooted in prayer.

“You walk the village like nothing has changed,” she continued. “But the dogs whimper at night. The trees don’t rustle anymore. And the children—if they’re born at all—no longer dream.”

---

Belen’s expression cooled.

“You speak of things you don’t understand, Ma’am.”

“I understand enough,” Fabiana said.

She reached for the brass relic wrapped in linen. Uncovered it.

Held it out between them—not with hatred, but with sorrow.

> “The woman in the mountains gave you something. But it didn’t come from God.”

---

Belen took one step closer.

The relic **burned**—faint wisps of smoke rising from Fabiana’s palm.

She didn’t let go.

> “You were mine to raise,” Fabiana whispered.  
> “But not mine to keep.  
> You chose something else.”

---

Belen’s smile broke. Not into rage—but grief twisted backward into cruelty.

“You cast me out.”

“I gave you herbs. A roof. I gave you prayer.”

“You gave me silence when I needed love,” Belen hissed.

“Love corrects,” Fabiana said. “And you wouldn’t be corrected.”

---

A long pause.

Then Belen’s hand moved fast.

Faster than human.

Her fingers **closed around Fabiana’s throat**, and **lifted** her effortlessly off the ground.

Fabiana did not struggle.

She did not scream.

She looked Belen in the eyes—those eyes she once blessed at baptism—and whispered her last words:

> “I forgive you.  
> In the name of the One who sees you still.”

---

Then—

A sickening crack.

Her neck snapped sideways.

The relic fell from her hand, bounced once on the floor, and rolled beneath the bed.

---

Belen stood over her for a moment, chest heaving.

Fabiana’s body lay crumpled on the wooden floorboards, hands still gently folded as if in prayer.

The candle guttered.

Then went out.

And somewhere in the fields,  
**something began to hum.**

---

Anna woke with a gasp.

The room was dark.

Still.

Miguel lay sleeping beside her, one arm across his chest.

The relic was warm beneath her pillow.

And at the altar, a single candle—unlit when she’d gone to bed—now burned steady.

No smoke. No match.

Just flame.

Anna sat up, hand on her belly.

The child stirred beneath her ribs, as if sensing something solemn had passed through the house.

She whispered:

> “I remember, Lola.”

Then she rose.

And began to prepare.

---

The next day bloomed too quietly.

No dogs barked. No birds called.

The wind moved only the highest leaves, and the air near the house felt like **held breath**.

Miguel and Lito were outside, stringing bottles of saltwater above the windows, tying sprigs of basil and garlic into the lintels, mixing ash and oil for anointing.

Anna stood by the window, watching them. She felt… strange.

Lighter. But not at peace.

The baby had moved again in the night. Once. Then not again. Her hand hadn’t left her belly since.

She stepped into the hallway to fetch a cup of water—

And found **Mira** standing in the kitchen doorway.

No sound. No knock. Just there.

Anna jumped. Her other hand went to the relic around her neck.

Mira raised both hands.

“I didn’t come to harm you.”

Her voice was soft. A little hoarse.

Anna stared at her. “How did you get through the salt?”

Mira looked down. “I waited. Till the door opened. You didn’t close it fully.”

Anna’s throat went dry.

Miguel and Lito were just outside. A shout would be enough.

But Mira didn’t move closer.

She didn’t threaten.

She _trembled_.

“I want to leave her,” she said.

Anna blinked. “Belen?”

Mira nodded.

“I don’t want this,” she whispered. “I never did. But I didn’t have… what you had.”

“What do you think I had?”

“Warmth,” Mira said, eyes fixed on her. “Hands that touched you and didn’t take. A mother who sang. A man who watches over you without wanting to control you.”

There was bitterness in it.

But there was also hunger.

“I don’t want to eat,” Mira said. “I want to feel.”

Silence.

Then:

> “She’s not strong right now. She’s preparing. That makes her slow. Weak. If we go now, I can show you where she keeps it. The pasa. We can end it.”

Anna glanced toward the window.

Miguel was up a ladder. Lito was setting candles by the gate.

The door was open. A step. Two.

She looked at Mira.

And what she saw—just for a moment—was **not evil**.

It was _what Anna could have become_, had her mother’s faith not lived long enough to whisper in the dark.

---

“I’ll come,” Anna said.

She didn’t fetch Miguel.

She didn’t grab the relic.

Only her rosary.

And as the two women stepped out into the fading afternoon light, a soft breeze stirred the curtains—

And blew the door shut behind them.

**[End of Part V]**
