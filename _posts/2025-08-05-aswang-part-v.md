**Aswang – Part V: Faith Draws the Blade**  
_"There is a time to kill, and a time to heal"_
_(Ecclesiasties 3:3)_

---

The house was quiet in the early dusk. The kind of quiet that felt less like rest and more like **waiting**.

They sat around the table with the last of the rice and fish untouched.

Anna cradled a cup of lukewarm salabat. Miguel was sharpening the machete he’d found in the back shed, the rasp of steel filling the silence. Tatay Lito lit a stick of incense and placed it by the door, whispering a short prayer under his breath.

> _“San Lorenzo, be our shield…”_

Then he turned to them, the candlelight flickering in his eyes.

“We need to talk about what comes next.”

Anna nodded. Her face was drawn, her eyes hollow but alert.

Miguel didn’t look up from the blade. “We wait, right? Hold the line?”

Lito shook his head.

“We can’t keep holding ground forever,” he said. “She’s not just hunting anymore. She’s preparing.”

“For what?” Anna asked.

Lito glanced at her belly.

“For a ritual,” he said. “The final one. The _pasa_ must be rooted in something. That’s why she hasn’t killed us yet. She’s preparing the altar.”

“Here?” Miguel asked.

“Not in this house. But in the village. Near the trees. Near the old hut.” Lito’s voice dropped. “She’s circling. She’s feeding. And when the hour comes, she’ll try to break the barrier and take what she wants.”

Anna’s voice was quiet.

“What if we leave?”

“We’ve tried,” Miguel said. “We’ll end up right back here.”

Lito nodded. “She’s sealed the village. Not physically. Spiritually. The circle won’t open again unless she’s broken.”

A heavy pause settled between them.

Anna looked down at her stomach.

The child stirred. A slow, deliberate shift—like turning toward something.

“I don’t want him to grow up in fear,” she whispered.

Miguel reached across the table, his hand over hers.

“He won’t.”

Lito spoke softly, but with finality.

> “Then we must kill her.”

Miguel finally set down the blade.

There was no argument.

No moral debate.

Just stillness.

Like the stillness before a hammer falls.

---

Miguel stood and checked the salt line for the sixth time that day.

Anna remained at the table, staring into the candle’s flicker.

She could feel something pressing at the edge of her thoughts—not a voice, not a presence.

Just a waiting.

A hunger not her own.

She swallowed.

And prayed without words.

**Aswang – Part VII (continued): The False Escape**

---

The next day bloomed too quietly.

No dogs barked. No birds called.

The wind moved only the highest leaves, and the air near the house felt like **held breath**.

Miguel and Lito were outside, stringing bottles of saltwater above the windows, tying sprigs of basil and garlic into the lintels, mixing ash and oil for anointing.

Anna stood by the window, watching them. She felt… strange.

Lighter. But not at peace.

The baby had moved again in the night. Once. Then not again. Her hand hadn’t left her belly since.

She stepped into the hallway to fetch a cup of water—

And found **Mira** standing in the kitchen doorway.

No sound. No knock. Just there.

Anna jumped. Her other hand went to the relic around her neck.

Mira raised both hands.

“I didn’t come to harm you.”

Her voice was soft. A little hoarse.

Anna stared at her. “How did you get through the salt?”

Mira looked down. “I waited. Till the door opened. You didn’t close it fully.”

Anna’s throat went dry.

Miguel and Lito were just outside. A shout would be enough.

But Mira didn’t move closer.

She didn’t threaten.

She _trembled_.

“I want to leave her,” she said.

Anna blinked. “Belen?”

Mira nodded.

“I don’t want this,” she whispered. “I never did. But I didn’t have… what you had.”

“What do you think I had?”

“Warmth,” Mira said, eyes fixed on her. “Hands that touched you and didn’t take. A mother who sang. A man who watches over you without wanting to control you.”

There was bitterness in it.

But there was also hunger.

“I don’t want to eat,” Mira said. “I want to feel.”

Silence.

Then:

> “She’s not strong right now. She’s preparing. That makes her slow. Weak. If we go now, I can show you where she keeps it. The pasa. We can end it.”

Anna glanced toward the window.

Miguel was up a ladder. Lito was setting candles by the gate.

The door was open. A step. Two.

She looked at Mira.

And what she saw—just for a moment—was **not evil**.

It was _what Anna could have become_, had her mother’s faith not lived long enough to whisper in the dark.

---

“I’ll come,” Anna said.

She didn’t fetch Miguel.

She didn’t grab the relic.

Only her rosary.

And as the two women stepped out into the fading afternoon light, a soft breeze stirred the curtains—

And blew the door shut behind them.
