**Aswang – Part III: Where Reason Alone Fails**  

_"Lord, I believe. Help my unbelief."_ 
_(Mark 9:24)_

---

The afternoon light filtered soft and amber through the woven curtains.

Anna moved slowly around the bedroom, putting things back where they belonged—half from habit, half from the ache of needing to keep busy. The relic had been placed carefully on the bedside altar, wrapped once more in Biana’s cloth. Four candles ringed it in saucers of salt, their wicks trimmed, unlit for now.

She found it behind the altar, tucked behind an old _Libro de Santa Misa_, its leather cover brittle with age.

Not a letter.

A **journal**.

Handwritten in Biana’s careful, looping script. Pages filled with herbs, novena schedules, reflections on the village births.

But near the end, the ink grew heavier. Lines crossed out. Smudged.

Anna flipped carefully until she found an entry dated just a few months before her death.

> _She came again today. Still no grey in her hair. Still the same soft voice._  
> _She brings food, herbs. But the children she delivers are quieter than they should be._
> 
> _I see Mira watching the mothers. Her eyes are too old for her face._  
> _I tried to warn Lito. He smiled and said I needed to rest._
> 
> _Lord, if I am wrong, forgive me._  
> _But if I am right… let someone be ready._
> 
> _I keep the relic hidden now. In case I grow too weak to speak aloud._
> 
> _I light a candle for my dear apong Anna every Sunday. She’s far, but the Lord is farther and still hears me._
> 
> _If I don’t see her again, may the angels bring her comfort. I don’t know if she believes anymore._
> 
> _Faith is a gift. Sometimes the embers feel cold. But the flame can still catch._

Anna stopped reading.

Her throat closed.

She touched the edge of the page. It smelled faintly of candle wax and bay leaf.

“I’m here, Lola,” she whispered. “I’m here now.”

Miguel had tried twice that morning to rebook the flights.

No signal. Then the site wouldn’t load. Then the payment portal failed.

It wasn’t supernatural. It was just rural. At least, that’s what he told himself.

He sat outside on the bamboo bench beside the hibiscus, laptop closed, sweating through his shirt. The smell of charcoal and wet soil carried on the air. Lito was somewhere in the chapel again. Anna was resting. She hadn’t spoken much that morning.

He ran his thumb absently along a splinter in the bench, thinking of the night before—Mira’s quiet shape in the road, the clay cup she’d left on the gatepost, her voice like a thread pulled tight: I hope you fight.

He hadn’t told Anna, but he kept replaying the way she said it. Not mocking. Not kind. Just… certain.

He watched a lizard creep along the fence.

And felt it again—that unmistakable sensation.

Someone was watching him.

---

Later that day, Lito returned from the chapel, sun-worn and silent.

They sat in the shade, sipping lukewarm salabat. Miguel needed the distraction.

“Anna told me you used to be a teacher.”

“I was,” Lito said. “High school. Literature and History.”

“Before the chapel?”

He nodded. “Before the silence.”

Miguel looked over. “What do you mean?”

Lito didn’t answer right away. Then he leaned back, eyes on the branches above.

“My wife was named Luisa. She bled out giving birth to our daughter. We named her Corazon.”

Miguel said nothing.

“She lived for three hours. That’s all.”

A long pause.

“For a while, I hated the rosary,” Lito said. “I hated how it felt like begging. I stopped praying. Stopped teaching. Drank instead.”

“What changed?”

“My mother.”

Miguel nodded slowly. “Biana.”

“She didn’t say a word,” Lito said. “Just sat beside me on the porch one night. Put a rosary in my hand and closed my fingers around it.”

Another pause.

“She didn’t leave till I prayed one decade.”

Miguel was quiet, throat tight.

“I’ve prayed every night since.”

Lito turned to him then, really looked at him. “You’re going to be a father.”

Miguel nodded.

“There will come a night when you won’t be able to reason with what comes for your family.”

He hesitated.

“You’ll have to pray. Not because you believe - at least not at first. Because it changes you. It's what holds the line.”

---

That evening, Miguel walked alone to the edge of the property, needing air. The sky had turned strange—yellow at the horizon, cloudless but low. He knelt by the gate, checking the hinge again, and felt that prickle again.

But it wasn’t Mira.

It was **Belen**.

She stepped out from between the trees, hands behind her back, eyes kind.

Too kind.

“Evening, Miguel,” she said, her Ilonggo precise, old.

He stood slowly. “Aling Belen.”

“You’re out walking late,” she said.

“Just stretching my legs.”

“Good,” she said. “The body must stay strong for what’s coming.”

Miguel didn’t reply.

“I saw your wife today,” she said, almost wistful. “She’s full of life. But life is very fragile.”

She took another step forward.

“I used to be like you. Educated. Proud. Certain. Then I saw what waited in the shadows of birth.”

Miguel’s pulse ticked upward. “And what’s that?”

She smiled, but her eyes were flat.

“Something older than hospitals. Older than prayer. The thing that feeds when others fast.”

She reached out gently and touched his arm.

The skin beneath her fingers burned—_cold_, but burning.

“You’ll see soon,” she said. “You’re strong. But you must learn when to kneel.”

Then she turned and walked into the trees.

No footsteps. No sound.

---

That night, he didn’t tell Anna what Belen had said. She was pale, holding her belly like it hurt.

Instead, he sat beside her, hand on her back, and whispered—awkward, fumbling:

“Our Father… who art in heaven…”

Anna blinked, startled.

“…hallowed be Thy name…”

She reached for his hand.

He didn’t stop praying.

---

It began just after midnight.

Anna woke first—heart pounding, sweat clinging to her skin. The dream had been strange: she was back in the field, only now the stalks of rice were shaped like limbs. Belen stood in the distance, wearing white, mouth full of ash.

Miguel froze halfway across the sala.

The candles on the altar were lit. They hadn’t been lit that morning.

The flames were black.

Smoke curled inward, drawn into the brass reliquary like it was breathing.

Anna stepped into the doorway, eyes wide. “Don’t touch it.”

The wicks sputtered once, then went out — leaving only the smell of rotting flowers.

Then silence.

Miguel stood. “We’re leaving,” he said.

---

By dawn, they had packed again.

Miguel loaded the bags into the van with sharp, efficient movements. Anna said little. Her rosary hung from her wrist now, swinging gently as she walked. The wind had picked up, but the trees didn’t sway.

Tatay Lito watched them from the porch.

“You won’t get far,” he said softly.

“I have to try,” Miguel replied.

“I understand. But listen.”

He stepped forward, reached into his pocket, and pressed a small linen pouch into Miguel’s palm. Inside: **blessed salt**.

“Lay this,” Lito said. “Around your child tonight. If you return.”

Miguel didn’t respond. He only got in the van.

---

The road out was still slick from last week’s flood. But passable.

They made it two kilometers before the **rear wheels lurched**, and the van sank half a foot into the roadside ditch.

Miguel cursed. Got out. Mud came up to his ankles.

He popped the trunk to check the jack—

And froze.

Something lay on the spare tire.

A small, withered **arm**. Greyed. Shriveled. Fingers curled into a claw. Gnawed at the wrist.

He staggered back, bile rising in his throat.

Anna stepped out of the van and saw his face.

She looked over the edge. Said nothing.

Only reached for the reliquary in her pocket and pressed it to her lips.

---

They walked back.

Neither of them spoke until they reached the gate.

Lito was waiting, as if he’d never moved.

He handed Anna a candle, and Miguel the pouch of salt.

“Tonight,” he said, “we stop running.”

---

That evening, as the sun bled over the horizon, they worked together—three bodies moving like one.

Miguel drew a careful line of salt around the perimeter of the house, reinforcing the doors, the windows, even the base of the crib. Lito sprinkled holy water at each corner and whispered prayers under his breath.

Anna lit four candles at the corners of the room, each one pressed into a saucer of salt.

The air felt thicker when they finished. Not safer. But clearer.

Like they had _declared something_.

That night, after Anna fell asleep, Miguel stood by the window, staring into the trees.

He opened his mouth to speak, and the words came — not polished, not certain. Just **real**.

“God… I don’t know what I’m doing. But if You’re there — watch her. Watch the baby. Give me the strength to protect them.”

He paused.

Then added: “I’m not ready. But I’ll do what it takes.”

He pressed the salt pouch into his chest and stayed by the window until dawn.
