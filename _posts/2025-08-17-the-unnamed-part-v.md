**Part V - When Silence Shatters**  

_“The truth was spoken, and the blood answered.”_

---

The van rolled to a stop at the gate. Gabi stepped out first, pulling it open as Kin carried Elia inside, her small frame wrapped in a pale blanket. She hadn’t stirred since the hospital. The doctors had run every test they could, found no injury, no sign of illness. Whatever had caused it, they couldn’t yet say.

It wasn’t life-threatening, so they’d sent her home, promising to check in and giving instructions for her care — keep her warm, monitor her breathing, call immediately if anything changed.

Len was already in the doorway, sleeves rolled to the elbow, hair tied back. She’d cleared a space in one of the quieter rooms, a low bed pressed against the wall, fresh sheets smelling faintly of soap. Without a word, she helped Kin lower Elia down, adjusting the blanket so it sat snug across her shoulders.

“She’ll rest better here,” Len murmured, smoothing Elia’s hair with a touch so light it was almost an act of reverence.

Gabi lingered by the doorframe, watching the way she moved — calm, unhurried, as if every gesture had purpose. It was the same quiet steadiness he remembered from before, when his world had been falling apart and hers had been holding too much together.

“Did they say anything more?” she asked without looking up.

“No,” Gabi said. “Just that they’ll keep checking in.”

Len nodded once, tucking the stuffed monkey into the crook of Elia’s arm. “Then we wait.”

She rose and brushed past him toward the kitchen, the faint scent of her shampoo following her. “You must be hungry. I’ll make tea.”

For a moment, Gabi stayed there, watching her go — the sound of her footsteps on the wooden floor pulling at something deep in him. The years between them felt thinner than they had in days, as if the old rhythm of shared silences was still somewhere in reach.

---

The kitchen smelled faintly of ginger and lemongrass. Len moved easily between the counter and the small gas range, her sleeves still rolled, steam rising from the kettle. She didn’t look flustered — even after hours of sitting at Elia’s side — just quietly focused.

Gabi stepped in, leaning against the doorframe. “You’ve done a lot today,” he said.

Len glanced over her shoulder, a half-smile touching her lips. “It’s nothing. She’s family.”

The way she said it carried no hesitation, though she had no blood tie to Elia. That simple certainty made something twist in Gabi’s chest.

He crossed to the table, watching her pour the tea into two mismatched mugs. “I forgot how much you cook for everyone,” he said, remembering evenings a decade ago when she’d bring over extra food for his father when he was sick, quiet and dependable even when he barely spoke to her.

Len set a mug in front of him, meeting his eyes briefly before sitting opposite. “And I remember you never liked ginger tea. You’d drink it anyway, but you always made a face.”

A small laugh escaped him. “Still do.”

For a moment, they sat in the easy quiet that used to come naturally — the sound of the kettle settling, the faint creak of the house in the fog.

“How are you holding up?” she asked, her tone gentler now.

Gabi hesitated, fingers curling around the mug. “Trying not to think too much. Just… keeping my head above water.”

Len studied him, her expression unreadable. “You’ve always been good at that.” The words weren’t unkind, but they lingered between them — an old truth neither had named aloud in years.

He looked down at the steam curling from his tea, wishing for something to say that wouldn’t sound clumsy. But before he could, the muffled sound of Kin’s voice came from down the hall, low and urgent, pulling them both back to the present.

---

Kin sat at the small desk in the room he’d claimed, the glow of his laptop the only light. The rest of the house was quiet — Gabi and Len in the kitchen, Elia asleep, Anding retreating early to her own quarters.

The cursor blinked in the empty email window. He’d already written to the bishop once, two days ago, and had received only a perfunctory acknowledgment from the chancery secretary. _We’ll review your request in due course._ No indication that anyone grasped the urgency.

He began to type, the words coming harder this time.

> Your Excellency,
> 
> I believe the disturbances here are preternatural in nature. This is not a haunting, nor a residual presence. I have witnessed manifestations consistent with demonic infestation — of both place and object.
> 
> The most recent incident has left a child in an unresponsive state. I implore you to permit the use of the Rite of Exorcism, or to send an appointed exorcist without delay.
> 
> Every day we wait, the danger grows.

He stopped, fingers hovering over the keys. For a moment, he thought of deleting it — the tone might seem insistent, even disrespectful. But the memory of Elia on the floor, her eyes rolled back, kept him from softening it.

He hit _Send_.

Leaning back, he reached for the worn black leather volume beside him — _De Exorcismis et Supplicationibus Quibusdam_. His fingers traced the creases in the cover, the familiar Latin prayers on the opening pages. He had never used them outside of sanctioned rites, but the words were etched into him as surely as the Creed.

He stayed there long after the screen dimmed, listening to the faint hiss of the fog outside the windows, as if the house itself was breathing.

---

Gabi fell asleep in the chair beside Elia’s bed. The steady rise and fall of her breathing had been oddly comforting, the soft sound of Len moving in the kitchen fading to silence as the house settled for the night.

He dreamt of the sala first — but it wasn’t the sala as it was now. The vigil chair was empty, shadows pooling in the corners. From the far end of the room, Lolo Ben stepped forward, barong neat, blanket folded across his lap now draped over one arm.

“Lolo,” Gabi said, rising. But when he moved closer, Ben’s mouth didn’t open. Instead, he lifted one hand and pointed — not to Gabi, but past him. Through the wall. Toward the mountains beyond.

The fog swelled, seeping in through the windows, curling around their feet. Shapes began to form in it — figures moving slowly along an unseen road. Gabi turned to watch them, unease prickling down his spine. They were men and women, but wrong somehow: some missing their heads entirely, others clutching them to their chests. Their feet didn’t touch the ground.

One of the headless forms turned toward him, and though it had no face, he felt its attention like a weight. The fog pressed in until it filled his mouth, his lungs, and—

He woke with a sharp gasp. The room was dark except for the faint spill of light from the hall. Elia still lay sleeping, the stuffed monkey tucked beneath her chin.

Gabi stood and crossed to the window. Outside, the fog lay heavy over the compound, obscuring the pines and the road beyond the gate. He thought he saw a flicker of movement — a pale, drifting form — but it vanished as soon as he focused on it.

He told himself it was nothing. Just the mind carrying scraps of a dream into waking. But he stayed at the window longer than he meant to, watching, waiting.

---

The fog had thinned by morning, but the house felt no lighter. Gabi found Tita Anding alone in the sala, perched on the low bench by the wall. Sunlight pushed in through the window slats, catching on the dust in the air.

She held her rosary tight, the beads wrapped so many times around her fingers it looked as if she were trying to bind herself with it. Her gaze was fixed on the vigil chair, unblinking.

“You should eat something, Tita,” Gabi said from the doorway.

Her eyes shifted to him — sharp at first, then wavering. “Eat? With my baby lying like that?” Her voice cracked.

He stepped closer. “She’s stable. The doctors—”

She cut him off with a quick shake of her head. “Don’t tell me about doctors, anak. This is not theirs to fix.” She looked past him again toward the chair, lips thinning. “It’s my fault. I kept my mouth shut. Told myself it was for the good of the family.”

Gabi’s pulse quickened. “What do you mean?”

She drew a deep breath, the sound like it hurt her. “Carlos… he went to the cave. I told him not to. Said he was looking for something valuable to pay his debts. He broke open Levi’s coffin.”

The words landed heavy.

“And you knew?”

“I knew after. But there was more.” Her voice dropped low. “Your Lolo Ben found out. Confronted him. They argued. Carlos had been drinking. He… pushed him. Down the slope. And when he saw Ben wasn’t moving, he ran.”

The ticking clock filled the silence between them.

Gabi’s hands curled into fists. “And you covered for him?”

“I told myself it was an accident,” she said, voice trembling. “That nothing good would come from tearing the family apart. But now—” Her throat tightened. “Now the dead won’t rest, and my apong lies cold... I hear him in my dreams.”

Gabi’s breath came hard, heat flooding through him. It wasn’t a choice anymore.

“Where is he?”

Anding didn’t answer right away. She just looked at him, perhaps seeing exactly what he meant to do - and not stopping him.

---

A faint thud carried in from the street — the hollow slam of a bottle hitting the pavement.  

Through the thin curtains, Gabi caught the silhouette of a broad figure loitering just beyond the gate, smoke curling from one hand. Even in the fog, the posture was unmistakable. Carlos.  

He leaned against the fence post, muttering into his phone, his voice low but sharp. Every few seconds, he glanced toward the house, as if deciding whether to come in.  

Then he flicked the cigarette into the gutter and started down the road toward the row of sari-sari stores and bars that clung to the corner by the jeepney stop.

Gabi stayed at the window a moment longer, the echo of Anding’s words heavy in his ears. Carlos wasn’t going anywhere. Not yet.

“Carlos!” Gabi’s voice cut through the air.

The laughter died. Carlos glanced over, smirk curling one corner of his mouth. “Well, if it isn’t the prodigal. Come to drink with us?”

Gabi didn’t slow. “We need to talk.”

“Talk?” Carlos straightened, his size filling the space between them. “About what?”

“About Lolo Ben. And the cave.”

The smirk faltered. His two companions exchanged a quick look. “Careful, boy,” Carlos said, voice low. “You don’t know what you’re—”

“You killed him,” Gabi said.

Carlos’s jaw worked. “He fell.”

“You pushed him.”

The change was instant — Carlos stepped forward, the smell of liquor sharp on his breath. “Watch your mouth.”

“I’m done watching,” Gabi said, his fists tightening. “You desecrated the cave. You murdered Lolo Ben. And you’ve been hiding behind Tita’s silence while the rest of us—”

Carlos swung first, a wide, drunken hook. Gabi ducked instinctively, years-old muscle memory sparking to life. He drove a short, clean hook into Carlos’s ribs. The big man grunted, swung again, caught Gabi’s shoulder. Pain flared, but Gabi stepped in close, throwing another punch — this one smashing against Carlos’s jaw.

Carlos stumbled back, and Gabi followed. A shove, a trip, and Carlos hit the ground hard, the back of his head thudding against the wet pavement.

Then Gabi was on him.

Fist after fist came down, each blow sharper, heavier than the last. He wasn’t thinking anymore — just the years of grief, the shame of leaving, the guilt of not being here when it mattered, all of it pouring through his knuckles. Blood welled under them, streaking across his skin. Carlos’s hands came up, but Gabi knocked them aside, his breath coming in ragged bursts.

“Gabi!”

A hand clamped hard on his shoulder and wrenched him back. Kin — face grim, breath tight — hauled him to his feet, shoving him toward the wall.

“That’s enough!” Kin’s voice cut through the pounding in Gabi’s ears.

But Gabi’s fists were still clenched, body still angled toward Carlos as if ready to surge again. His chest heaved, the roar of blood in his head drowning everything—

Until a smaller hand pressed against his arm.

“Gabi… please.”

He turned, and Len was there, her face pale but steady, eyes locked on his. No anger, no judgment — just the quiet plea of someone who _saw_ him, the whole of him, even in this.

Her touch was light, but it held him like a weight. His breath shuddered. The fight drained out of him all at once, leaving only the ache in his knuckles and the throb of shame in his chest.

Behind them, Carlos groaned, rolling to one side, blood slick on the pavement.

Kin’s grip loosened, but he didn’t step away. Len’s hand stayed on Gabi’s arm until he finally turned from the scene.

They left Carlos where he lay, his companions finally moving in to help him sit up. No one spoke to Gabi. No one stopped them.

Kin walked on one side of him, a steady presence, his hand still hovering near Gabi’s shoulder as if he might need to pull him back again. Len stayed close on the other side, her hand brushing his arm once more before she let it fall.

The fog outside had thickened, spilling through the doorway in pale, restless ribbons. A sudden cold gust slid between them, carrying with it a sound too low and wrong to belong to the street — something that seemed to brush the back of Gabi’s neck.

Kin’s gaze cut toward the dark, his jaw tightening.

“We should go,” he said.

They stepped out into the mist, leaving Carlos slumped against the wall.

Kin’s hand stayed on Gabi’s shoulder a moment longer, the pressure steady, grounding. “You were a breath away from losing more than him,” he said quietly. His eyes searched Gabi’s face — not condemning, but heavy with something like grief. “I know what it is to want justice so badly it burns.” He let the words settle, then added, softer still, “But that fire takes more than it gives, if you let it.”

Gabi didn’t answer. His knuckles throbbed with each heartbeat, the sting of split skin a reminder of how close he’d come.

As they reached the compound gate, Len looked at him — really looked — her eyes searching his face as if she might find the boy she’d known under the man he’d become. There was no judgment in her gaze, only a quiet, steady warmth that made something in him unclench. She didn’t speak, but in that silence was a promise: _I still see you._
