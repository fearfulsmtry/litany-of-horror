**Aswang – Part VII: Flesh and Fire**  

_“The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.”_
_(John 1:5)_

---

The trail was thinner than it should’ve been.

No footprints—just the subtle parting of leaves, a branch freshly snapped, a thread of cloth caught on bark. But Lito saw it all.

Miguel followed close behind, machete strapped to his back, the relic pressed against his chest like armor.

They moved quickly. Quietly.

The forest swallowed sound.

Even the wind held its breath.

---

“How far could they have gone?” Miguel asked.

“Far enough,” Lito said, not looking back.

His voice was grim. Steady. The voice of a man who had walked this path before—_too late_.

He paused at a fork in the trail, bent low, and brushed away a fallen leaf.

Beneath it: the faintest footprint in the loam.

Bare. Long.

Not Anna’s.

Mira’s.

Lito stood. “They’re circling toward the old clearing.”

“The hut?”

Lito nodded. “Belen’s altar is there.”

Miguel tightened the straps on his bag.

“How do we stop her?”

Lito didn’t answer at first.

He drew a small flask of holy oil and uncorked it.

Dipped his fingers in, and anointed his own forehead.

Then Miguel’s.

> “By faith,” he said.  
> “By blade.”

---

The sun was dying behind the trees now. The light went copper, then iron, then nothing.

The forest changed.

The air grew cold, then _wet_, like they’d stepped into the lungs of something sleeping.

And far ahead—

A faint sound.

Not wind.

Not leaves.

> **A voice. Singing.**

---

They froze.

Lito whispered: “The rite has begun.”

Miguel felt the relic pulse warm against his chest.

His hands closed around the machete handle.

He looked at Lito, voice low but firm.

> “Then we end it.”

Lito gave a single nod.

They stepped forward.

Toward the song.

Toward the blood.

Toward the womb waiting to be claimed.

---

The door to the hut shattered beneath Lito’s boot.

The air was **thick**, not with heat—but pressure. Like the inside of a wound.

Anna lay bound in the center of the room, surrounded by symbols that mocked the sacraments: rosaries made of hair, baptismal gowns stained and torn, crucifixes inverted and weeping oil.

Hovering above her was the **pasa**—a blackened, pulsing organ that looked like it had been grown in grief and blood. It beat softly, not with life, but with _hunger_.

Belen stood behind it.

No longer veiled.

No longer human.

Her limbs were _too long_, her skin **tight like bark stretched over bone**, her eyes **sunken black pits** that pulsed with false light.

She turned toward Miguel and Lito, a twisted smile spreading far beyond her cheekbones.

> “You came to witness the birth,” she crooned.  
> “How... delicious.”

---

Miguel stepped forward and flung a fistful of blessed salt at Belen.

She hissed. Recoiled.

She slashed at Miguel with her inhuman claws, knocking him to the ground.

Lito advanced. He pulled a small bottle of holy water from his belt. He uncorked the bottle and flung holy water at her.

The water sizzled on her skin. She **let out a scream that didn’t sound human**.

She lashed out, knocking the bottle from Lito’s hands. It shattered on the floor.

Miguel pushed himself up, hand going to the pouch at his chest. The **relic**.

The brass disk pulsed with warmth in his palm—faint light blooming as he raised it toward her.

Belen Recoiled again, this time with fear.

> “No!” she spat. “Keep it away!”

Miguel didn't speak.

He walked forward.

Deliberate.

Unflinching.

And **pressed the relic to her chest**.

---

The effect was immediate.

Belen **screamed**—not in rage, but **pure torment**.

The skin beneath the relic _cracked_, split, and a **light poured out**, not warm but searing.

Her true form began to emerge: a twisted fusion of _maternal imagery and monstrous hunger_. Multiple wombs, hollow and sagging, opened along her belly. Her face melted into two—one smiling, one sobbing.

She fell to her knees.

Lito, stepped behind her and raised his **bolo**.

> “For you, Mama. And the ones we failed.”

He drove the blade into her back, _deep_—straight through the ribcage.

Her body spasmed.

Miguel raised his machete.

> “You will not take my child.  
> You will not touch my wife again.  
> You will not curse our home.
> Not while I still breathe.”

He struck once.

Then again.

On the third blow—**her head fell**.

It hit the stone floor with a wet crack.

The air stopped moving.

Then exhaled.

A great wind blew out the black candles, and **the pasa dropped**, still pulsing.

---

Mira screamed.

She lunged for it, eyes wide with longing and terror.

> “She’s still in it! She promised! If I swallow it, it will be mine! It belongs to me!”

She reached—

And Anna moved.

Still bound. Still bleeding.

But she reached the **broken altar shard** and drove it into Mira’s side.

The girl gasped—stared.

For a moment—

Anna saw the **child** again.

The girl who only wanted to be loved.

But love, _real love_, tells the truth.

And the truth was: **Mira had chosen this**.

She collapsed. Twitching.

---

Silence.

Then Anna’s breath.

Ragged. Steady.

Miguel ran to her side, slicing the cords. He held her. Pressed his head to her shoulder.

> “It’s over,” he whispered.

Anna didn’t answer.

She reached out instead—toward the **relic**, still glowing faintly.

She pressed it to her own chest.

> “No,” she said, “it’s just beginning.”
