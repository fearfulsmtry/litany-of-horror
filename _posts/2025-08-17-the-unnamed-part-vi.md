**Part VI: The Mark**

_“They withheld the truth, and the enemy claimed his prize.”_

---

The kitchen smelled faintly of ginger and broth. Len moved between the counter and the hallway, where the door to Elia’s room stood slightly ajar.

Gabi sat at the far end of the table, sleeves rolled up, one hand resting palm-up while Len dabbed at his knuckles with a warm, damp cloth. The skin was split and raw from the fight, a faint tremor still running through him.

“You’ll scar if you don’t clean it properly,” she said softly, wringing the cloth.

“I’m not worried about scars.”

“You should be,” she replied, dabbing again — gentler this time. “They tell stories you can’t take back.”

He caught her eye at that. “And what story will this one tell?”

“That you were angry,” she said, setting the cloth aside to check the swelling, “and that you couldn’t hold it in.” Her thumb lingered at the edge of the bruise, her touch careful but warm. “But also… that you cared enough to fight.”

She moved to fetch a small jar of ointment from the counter, pausing instead to lean into the hallway and check on Elia. Satisfied the girl was still resting, she returned to Gabi’s side.

“You’ve hardly stopped since she came home,” he said.

Len shrugged, unscrewing the jar. “Someone has to keep her comfortable. And I’m used to looking after people.”

“I know,” he said, voice lower now. “It’s who you are.”

She looked at him then — not with the guarded distance she’d kept in the first days after his return, but with something warmer, deeper.

Len dipped her fingers in the ointment and reached for his hand again. “This will sting,” she murmured.

He didn’t flinch.

---

Len worked the ointment into the bruised skin, her fingertips light. Gabi’s eyes stayed on her face, tracing the curve of her brow, the faint shadows under her eyes from too many sleepless nights.

The back door creaked.

Father Kin stepped in from the yard, his cassock hem brushing the floor, the damp air clinging to his shoulders. He paused just inside, taking in the scene: Len bent over Gabi’s hand, the easy closeness between them, the way Gabi didn’t pull back.

Kin didn’t speak right away. His gaze flicked to Elia, noting her stillness, then back to the pair at the table. Something passed over his face — too quick to name — before he set his umbrella against the wall.

“How is she?” he asked, nodding toward Elia.

“The same,” Len said without looking up. “Still stable. Still… not here.”

Kin stepped closer, his eyes lingering on Gabi’s battered hand. “You should be careful with those,” he said. “Hands can do more harm than we mean.”

Gabi met his gaze. “Sometimes they need to.”

The moment held for a breath too long before Len pulled her hand back, reaching for the cloth again. “He’ll be fine,” she said, as if to both of them.

Kin gave a small nod, then moved to check on Elia, laying two fingers lightly against her wrist. His lips moved in a quiet prayer.

From where Gabi sat, the three of them formed a triangle in the small kitchen — the fog pressing thick against the windows, turning the glass to pale haze. Outside, the world felt muted, as though the night itself were holding its breath.

---

A faint patter began on the corrugated roof — light drizzle at first, the kind that beaded on the fogged glass before sliding down in slow rivulets. Outside, the haze was thinning, the outlines of trees starting to reappear.

In the dining room, the three of them sat at the old narra table, the warm glow of the overhead bulb softening the edges of the room.

Len set down a bowl in front of each of them — chicken tinola, steam curling upward, the scent of ginger and chili leaves cutting through the damp air. “Eat while it’s hot,” she said, taking her own seat.

Gabi reached for the rice, passing the serving spoon to Kin without needing to be asked. Kin accepted it with a faint smile. The motion was so familiar it caught Len off guard; for a heartbeat, it felt like no time at all had passed since they’d last sat together.

“You made this the same way you used to,” Gabi said after the first spoonful.

Len arched a brow. “How would you know? You were always too busy talking to notice what was in your bowl.”

He smirked, but there was no edge to it. “Some things you don’t forget.”

Kin glanced between them, one hand absently tracing the rim of his bowl. “She cooked for half the youth gatherings at the parish,” he said. “I’m surprised you even had time to eat back then.”

Len gave a small laugh. “You never let me skip,” she said to Kin. “Always insisted I sit down for at least a few bites.”

“And you always pretended not to be tired,” Kin replied.

For a moment the only sound was the clink of spoons against porcelain, the rain’s rhythm filling the gaps.

Len caught his gaze and held it a second too long before looking back to her soup. Kin saw the glance, but his expression didn’t change — only the smallest shift in his eyes, as though tucking the moment away for later.

---

The house had gone still for the night, save for the rain whispering against the eaves.

Gabi found Tita Anding in the sala, seated a few feet from the vigil chair. The rosary dangled loosely from her fingers, beads slipping one by one without her lips moving. A half-burnt candle flickered beside her, its light pooling over the polished floorboards.

Kin and Len came in quietly behind him, drawn by the sight.

Anding didn’t look up. “Your Lolo Ben and Levi were born minutes apart,” she began, her voice low and almost to herself. “Twins. They had the same eyes, the same stubbornness. And for most of their lives, they were inseparable.”

Her fingers tightened on the rosary. “Then she came. Clarissa, your lola.” She paused, glancing at Len as if the name itself carried a weight. “They both loved her. But she chose Ben. I don’t think Levi ever forgave him — not fully. He smiled, he stood beside them at the wedding, but something in him shifted.”

She lifted her gaze to the three of them. “Levi had charm, more than Ben. People listened to him. But he was restless, always looking for more. That’s when he started drifting toward the old ways — the rituals in the cliffs, the whispers of kulam. Dangerous things. Ben tried to pull him back, but Levi…” Her voice tightened. “Levi believed those rites could give him the life he thought he’d lost.”

The candle guttered, throwing shadows that deepened the lines of her face. “When he died, it was sudden. Some of our relatives — ones who still remembered him — took his body to the burial cave. They laid him to rest there, but it wasn't complete.”

No one spoke. The rain filled the silence, steady and relentless, and the last traces of fog slipped away from the windows.

Anding’s voice grew softer, but it trembled now. “I thought keeping the truth quiet would protect us. That what he’d touched would stay buried. But look at us now.” Her gaze shifted to Len, then to Gabi, and finally to Kin. “Don’t make his mistake. Or mine. Don’t let pride and silence poison what you still have.”

She lowered her head, the rosary once again moving through her fingers, her lips beginning the slow, trembling murmur of a prayer.

---

The rain hadn’t stopped, but the house seemed even quieter after Anding’s voice faded into prayer. Gabi lingered in the hallway, watching Len close the door to Elia’s room.

She noticed him there, half in shadow. “You’re not sleeping either?”

He shook his head. “Too much in my head.”

They ended up in the kitchen again, the soft hum of the old refrigerator filling the silence. Len poured water into two glasses and slid one to him. Her hands were steady, but her eyes… they were searching.

“Anding’s right,” she said finally. “About pride. About silence.”

He didn’t answer right away. “I thought leaving was the only way I’d survive. After my father died… I couldn’t breathe here. Everything reminded me of him. Of what I’d lost. I was too caught up in my own pain. I told myself you’d be better off without me.”

Her brow furrowed. “Better off? I was left wondering if I’d done something wrong. If I’d mattered at all.”

“You did.” The words came out rough, like they’d been waiting ten years to break free. “You were the only thing that mattered. And I threw it away.”

The rain tapped against the window in a steady rhythm. Len looked at him for a long moment, as if weighing something, then stepped closer. “Then stop throwing it away.”

She was so near now that he could see the faint sheen of moisture on her lashes, could feel the heat radiating off her skin. For a heartbeat, neither moved — and then Gabi reached for her, his hand brushing her cheek before he kissed her.

It wasn’t urgent, but it was deep — a mingling of longing, regret, and something that had never really gone away. Len didn’t pull back. Her hands found his shoulders, holding him there as if afraid he’d vanish again.

When they broke apart, her breath caught. She didn’t speak, but the look she gave him said everything.

Somewhere down the hall, a floorboard creaked. Gabi glanced toward the sound, but saw nothing. Still, a cold thread of unease wound through the moment, a reminder that nothing in this house stayed untouched for long.

---

Mist still clung low to the ground in the yard, stirred now and then by the drifting rain. It wasn’t the thick fog of earlier — more a gauzy remnant, pressed here and there against the windows. From the hall outside the kitchen, Kin paused, hearing the low murmur of voices.

He should have kept walking — to his room, to his prayers — but the voices held him still.

“…I told myself leaving would spare you,” Gabi was saying — his voice stripped of its usual guard, almost confessional.

Len’s reply came steady, but her shoulders betrayed a tremor. “Spare me? You left me wondering if I ever truly mattered.”

Kin edged closer, the kitchen light catching on Len’s profile as she stepped toward Gabi, their foreheads nearly touching.

“Then stop,” she said, the words soft but sure.

Kin’s chest tightened as Gabi cupped her face and kissed her. It was slow, unhurried — the kind of kiss that spoke of years lost and now found again. Len’s hands rested on his shoulders, holding him there as if to anchor him.

For a moment, Kin looked away, the ache sharp, undeniable. He had loved her once — perhaps still did, in some hidden corner of the heart he had given to God. But as he stood there, something in him stilled. A quiet clarity settled over him — not sudden, not loud, but steady, like a deep breath after holding it too long.

**He would not be Levi.**

This, too, was sacrifice — the daily surrender his vocation demanded. Not the grand gesture of one choice made long ago, but the living, breathing offering of the present moment. The ache remained, but it no longer pulled him apart.

If they were being given back to each other, then he would choose to be glad — even if the gladness came wrapped in loss.

He turned from the doorway, resolved. His calling had cost him before; it would cost him again. But it was still his.

And then it came deep, cold, and wrong — echoing from the sala:  
“***Gabriel…***”

---

Kin froze in the hallway. Gabi, startled, stepped out of the kitchen with Len at his side. Tita Anding emerged from the shadows near the stairs, her hand still clutching a rosary.

They all turned toward the vigil chair.

Lolo Ben’s corpse sat exactly where it had for days, but its head was lifted now, the milky eyes fixed straight ahead. The jaw worked stiffly, each movement accompanied by the faint crackle of dried sinew.

“***You...***” it said — the voice not his, but something hollow and resonant, a sound that seemed to scrape the walls. “***You ran when the mountain called. You crossed the sea and let the roots wither, leaving their shadows to watch for you.***”

Gabi’s blood turned to ice.

The head shifted, stiff as a puppet’s, to face Kin. ***“And you… always reaching for what walks beside another. Even now, you hide your hunger beneath a strip of cloth, thinking Heaven will mistake the veil for virtue.”***

Anding took a trembling step forward. “Stop this,” she said hoarsely, clutching her rosary to her chest.

The corpse’s head turned toward her in a series of jerks. ***“You bound your tongue and called it love. You wrapped your blood in silence, thinking it would keep them warm — and instead you have dressed the child for my table.”***

The light seemed to dim in the room, the candle flames bowing low. Gabi reached for Len’s hand, but the air between them tightened like a vice.

Len’s breath hitched, but before she could step back, the head turned to her. The voice softened, almost coaxing. “_**You hold yourself like stone, but stone still cracks. You stay because they lean on you — yet when you fall, they will not be there to lift you. Only I will catch you when the ground gives way.**_”

The corpse’s right hand twitched, lifting slowly, unnaturally. The fingers extended toward Len.

She cried out as a *searing heat bloomed on her forehead* — invisible at first, then erupting into a livid mark, a dark, curling sigil that seemed to sink into her skin like molten iron. The smell of burnt flesh filled the room.

Len collapsed to her knees, clutching her head, the mark still glowing faintly in the flickering light. Gabi dropped beside her, pulling her into his arms, but the thing in his grandfather’s body only laughed — a low, wet sound that rattled through the bones of the house.

Then the corpse’s head lolled forward, the body slack again. The sigil on Len’s brow pulsed once more before fading to an angry welt.

Nobody spoke. The only sound was Len’s ragged breathing and the rain whispering against the eaves, the air outside threaded with the damp ghost of the earlier fog.
