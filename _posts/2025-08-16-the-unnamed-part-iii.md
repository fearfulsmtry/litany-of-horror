**Part III - The First Cracks**

_“The prowler watched, seeking a soul to claim.”_

---

The room still smelled faintly of camphor and pinewood.

Gabi stood just inside the doorway, eyes adjusting to the dim light. The curtains were drawn, the air heavy, as if it had been holding its breath since Lolo Ben’s last night here. Dust clung to the carved bedposts and the tops of the bookshelves. On the desk, the crucifix still leaned against the wall where his grandfather had kept it.

He was halfway through rifling the bottom drawer when he heard the floorboard creak.

Len stood in the doorway, hair pulled back, an armful of folded linens balanced against her hip.

Her eyes flicked to the open drawer. “You’re looking for something.”

Gabi straightened, feeling caught. “Just… trying to understand.”

She stepped inside, set the linens on the bed. “If you think he hid something, it wouldn’t be in there. He kept his private things behind the armoire.”

He almost smiled. “You remember that?”

“I helped him clean in here once. He didn’t like to throw things away.”

They pushed the armoire aside together, the wood groaning against the floor. Behind it was a narrow shelf built into the wall, stacked with boxes and a tin canister wrapped in a yellowing cloth.

Len reached for the canister. “This was here last time. He told me not to open it.”

Gabi took it from her, unwrapped the cloth. Inside were letters, neatly bound with twine, and at the very bottom, an old photograph. Two young men stood side by side in the mountain light, one with his arm slung around the other’s shoulders. The second man’s face had been scratched away with deliberate strokes.

“Do you know him?” Gabi asked.

Len’s eyes lingered on the ruined face. “I heard his name once. Your lola said it softly… like she was remembering someone she loved.”

“What name?”

“Levi.”

The name seemed to draw the light from the room.

Gabi turned the photo over. On the back, in his grandfather’s deliberate, steady hand, were two words: **_Kabsat. (brother)_**  
The scratches where the man’s face should have been felt deeper now, almost carved into the paper.

Len rubbed her arms. “It’s cold in here.”

They left the photo where it was, facedown. Neither spoke. 

---

As they stepped into the hallway, Gabi found himself mouthing the name under his breath. **Levi**. It felt strange on his tongue — familiar in the way of a song half-remembered from childhood, something he might have overheard once in a conversation meant for other ears. Why had his lolo written _brother_ if the face was gone?

In the sala, Elia sat cross-legged on the floor, a sheet of paper in front of her, crayons scattered in a messy halo. She was bent low, her small hand moving quickly across the page.

When she noticed Len, she smiled — too wide, too sudden — and held the drawing up.

A dark shape filled most of the paper: a mountain slope, a narrow cave entrance marked with heavy strokes of black.

“He wants you to wear white,” Elia said.

Len blinked. “What did you say, iha?”

The girl tilted her head, as if listening to something neither of them could hear. “For the wedding.”

Gabi felt a chill crawl up the back of his neck. “Whose wedding?”

But Elia had already gone back to coloring, her lips moving as if humming to herself.

Gabi’s mind flicked — unbidden — back to the photo, to the black slash where a face should have been. It left him with the same unsettled sense: that someone was missing, but not gone.

Len placed a hand on Gabi’s arm — not in fear, but in that instinctive, grounding way she had. “She’s just playing,” she murmured, though she didn’t sound certain.

From the corner of the sala, the vigil chair loomed in its usual place. Lolo Ben’s folded hands rested motionless over the rosary. His face, lit by the soft halo of votive candles, seemed unchanged. And yet Gabi couldn’t shake the sense that his head had turned ever so slightly — angled toward Len.

**Father Kin - Dusk**

---

The sun was dipping low, the fog beginning to thread its way back through the pines. Len knelt by the long wooden table in the garden, trimming the stems of fresh chrysanthemums. The white petals seemed to hold the last of the light.

“Still working?” Kin’s voice came from the path behind her.

She looked up, smiling faintly. “These won’t last the night if I don’t.” She reached for another stem, fingers stained green from the shears. Her wrist brushed the rim of the pail, sending a bead of water sliding down. “The flowers in the sala are wilting already.”

Kin stepped closer, hands clasped loosely behind his back. The collar of his shirt was open, his black sweater flecked with stray pine needles from some earlier chore. “You’ve always been the one to keep things beautiful.”

She gave a small laugh. “Beautiful things don’t last unless you take care of them.”

For a moment, neither spoke. He watched her work — the careful way she measured each stem before placing it in the pail, the way her thumb always pressed the cut end as if testing its life. She still did that.

“How have you been, Len?” he asked finally.

Her smile faltered, though her hands kept moving. “I’ve been… here.” A pause. “After Gabi left, you went off to the seminary. Everyone was moving on. I thought I might, too.” She set the shears down for a moment, brushing a petal from her lap. “But my family needed me. I found work at the hospital, helped keep things together. The years just… went.”

Kin nodded slowly, the weight of her words hanging between them. He had visited the house in those years, seen her in passing — always busy, always carrying more than her share.

“You were always strong,” he said quietly.

She glanced up at him, something unspoken in her eyes. “Strength isn’t always a choice, Father.”

He looked away, to the pines beyond the fence, because it was easier than holding her gaze. “Kin,” he said softly. “I’ve always been Kin to you, Len.”

They both reached for the pail at the same time. His fingers hovered near hers for the briefest moment — close enough to feel the warmth, close enough for memory to stir — before he stepped back.

“You’ve been missed, Kin.”

The words sat between them, heavy as the dusk. He wanted to ask _by who_, but the answer would undo them both. So he only gave a small nod before walking away, the fog beginning to close behind him.

**Gabi - Afternoon**

---

The fog didn’t follow him into town. Here, the streets were bare under the white glare of mid-afternoon, motorcycles rattling past and vendors calling out prices for vegetables gone limp in the heat. Gabi moved through it quietly, the noise and smell both familiar and distant after so many years away.

He’d come to the hardware store for nails and lamp oil — small repairs at the house kept him busy enough to think. But as he crossed toward the plaza, movement at the mouth of a side alley caught his eye.

Carlos.

He stood at the mouth of the alley, broad shoulders blocking the light, his bulk making the older man look even smaller. Two other men flanked him, strangers but carrying themselves with the wary swagger Gabi knew too well — the way men stand when they expect a fight. Between them was the fourth man, clutching his ribs and mumbling apologies in a trembling voice.

Carlos’s voice cut through the noise, sharp and impatient. “You had weeks, Manong. Weeks.”

The older man tried to hand over a crumpled wad of pesos. Carlos snatched it, counted with exaggerated slowness, then tossed half back. “Interest,” he said flatly, before giving the man a shove that sent him staggering against the alley wall.

The two companions laughed — short, humourless — and Carlos waved them off. The old man slipped away, head bowed.

For a moment, Carlos lingered there, rolling the pesos in his hand, before tucking them into his shirt pocket and lighting a cigarette. He glanced toward the street — not looking for Gabi, but scanning for anyone who might have seen too much.

Gabi kept walking, ducking into the shadow of a shop awning before Carlos’s eyes could sweep his way. He told himself it wasn’t worth it, not here in the open.

Still, the image stayed with him — the shove, the sharpness in Carlos’s voice, the ease with which it all seemed to come.

**Carlos - Weeks Ago**

---

The debt collectors had given him until the end of the month. A week left now. He’d beaten enough people on their behalf to know exactly what would happen if he failed to pay.

He’d already sold his watch, his motorbike, even the bolo his father left him. Still short. Still desperate.

That’s when he remembered the stories — the Sagayo burial cave, the older graves sealed away with treasures. Lolo Ben had laughed at the idea when they were boys, but Carlos had heard different from other mouths. Gold teeth, heirloom beads, maybe even carved gongs worth a fortune to the right buyer.

It was foolish. Dangerous. Unthinkable. But it was also that or die owing men who liked to make examples.

The trail up the slope was an old one, overgrown in places, cut into the mountain like a scar. He’d walked it only once before, years ago, as a boy clinging to Lolo Ben’s hand. That day, the air had been clean, quiet, full of pine. Now, it smelled of rain-soaked moss and rot.

The mouth of the burial cave yawned out from the limestone, half-hidden by vines. Above it, the cliffside carried the shapes he’d come for — wooden coffins, lashed to the rock by sun-bleached rattan, some no longer whole. The old ones leaned at strange angles, lids ajar, bones jutting like pale roots.

He spat, forcing down the chill that slid over his skin. This was just wood and stone and bone. The dead were dead.

Inside, the air was cooler, close. His flashlight beam carved a narrow path through the dark, catching carved death chairs — the _sangadil_ — propped against the wall, their surfaces darkened with age. In the far corner lay the more recent burials: long wooden boxes stacked, carved with family names.

All but one.

It sat low against the wall, unmarked. The sight stirred something he couldn’t place — as if the wood itself had been made to forget. The air near it felt heavier, as if the cave itself was holding its breath.

Carlos crouched, prying at the lid with a crowbar. The wood groaned but did not splinter easily. Sweat rolled into his eyes; he cursed, wedged the bar deeper, and heaved.

The sound that escaped wasn’t the crack of timber but something wetter, a sigh that came from inside the box — and perhaps deeper still.

The lid shifted.

A smell rolled out, thick and clinging — not the sharpness of rot but the sweetness of something long sealed and spoiled. In the beam of his light, he saw the shape within: the remains of a man, bones bound with old cloth, the skull still crowned with hair gone silver-white.

Then the hair stirred.

A pressure hit his chest, like a hand shoving him hard enough to drive the air from his lungs. The flashlight flickered. In that strobing dark, the shadows on the wall began to move — not away from the light, but toward it, toward him.

He stumbled back, boots slipping on the damp stone. The lid of the coffin fell fully open with a wooden clap, and a sound slid out — half-breath, half-voice — in a language he didn’t know but felt in his bones.

A shape uncoiled from the coffin, taller than any man, its limbs long and wrong, joints bending where they shouldn’t. It had no face, only a suggestion of one in the shifting dark, like something remembered badly in a nightmare.

Carlos ran.

The trail back down was a blur of roots and stone, branches clawing at his arms, the weight of something just behind him — not touching, but close enough that the air seemed to bend around it. He didn’t stop until the lights of town were below him, and even then, his breath came ragged, carrying the scent of that cave as if it had followed him home.

By the time he reached the foot of the slope, his legs ached and his lungs burned. But worse was the name pounding in his skull — one he hadn’t heard in years, one he couldn’t place, yet felt as though it had been waiting for him in the dark. _Levi._

He spat into the dirt, but the taste of the cave clung to the back of his throat. When he peeled off his damp shirt to wipe his face, he froze. There, over his left breast, bloomed a dark, finger-shaped bruise — as if something had pressed its hand into him and refused to let go.

**Father Kin - Nightfall**

---

The compound had grown quieter as night took hold, the fog pressing close enough to bead on the window glass. Somewhere in the distance, a dog barked once, then fell silent.

Kin sat at the desk in his room, the day’s rosary still coiled beside his breviary. He had tried to pray after the others went to bed, but the words had dried on his tongue. Something in the house was listening.

He rose, candle in hand, and stepped into the hallway. The air was cooler here, touched by the scent of wax and pine smoke from the vigil in the sala.

That’s when he heard it — not footsteps, but the faint creak of the vigil chair.

He moved toward it, slow, careful, the way one approaches a wounded animal. The candlelight found the corpse of Lolo Ben sitting as it had all day, rosary looped between his folded hands. But the chair itself rocked ever so slightly, as if someone had just risen from it.

Kin’s gaze dropped to the floorboards. The wax from the vigil candles had pooled there, hardened into soft white ridges. And through them — bare, wet footprints. Small at first, childlike… but they grew longer, broader, until they were the size of a man’s. They led away from the chair, then vanished halfway across the room.

He felt the hairs rise at the back of his neck.

Something in the shadows shifted — not a trick of the light, but the light itself bending around a shape that didn’t belong. He caught only an impression: limbs too long, a posture that leaned forward as if smelling the air.

Kin clutched the candle tighter. The flame guttered, then steadied again.

This was no restless soul, no echo of the dead. This was something that had claimed a foothold here, something that could move through flesh and wood and silence itself at will.

He backed toward the chapel door. “Lord, guard this house,” he whispered. But even as he spoke, he knew — the house was already breached.
