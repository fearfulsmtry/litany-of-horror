**Part I - The Ache**

_“Hope deferred makes the heart sick.”_

_- Proverbs 13:12_

---

The townhouse was beautiful, but barren.

Pale stone floors. Orchids lined the window, petals flawless, sterile. Each surface gleamed, curated, untouched.

Jacob sat at the dining table, collared shirt half-unbuttoned, laptop open before him. The glow lit his face as he spoke into wireless buds, voice low and urgent. Numbers. Deadlines. Funding rounds. He rubbed his temple, jaw tight.

Chel lingered in the lounge. Sketchbook on her knees, pencil scratching quiet arcs. She drew a cradle, thin bars, a soft canopy that curved like a prayer. Her hand stilled. She shut the book quickly, sliding it beneath a cushion as though it were a secret she should not have drawn.

Jacob’s words sharpened. “Persistence pays. Nothing is impossible if you keep working for it.” His eyes flicked toward her, then back to the screen, as if she were another object in the room.

Chel rose, crossed into the kitchen. Poured water. The sound of it filled the silence. Her hand rested on her stomach, flat beneath the blouse. Empty still. Years of trying, and now the first round of IVF — samples sealed away in glass, waiting for news.

The call ended. Jacob exhaled, closing the laptop with a snap.

“They said we should hear back soon,” he said. His tone was steady, practiced. “Next week maybe.”

Chel nodded. Her eyes drifted to the orchids again. Perfect flowers. No fruit.

Jacob leaned back, stretching, collar askew. “We just need to keep at it.” The same words he used for his colleagues.

Chel’s lips parted. She wanted to answer, but instead turned back to the sink. Rinsed the glass until the water ran clear.

The townhouse held its silence. Beautiful. Lifeless.

Chel pressed her palms against the counter. She thought of the cradle hidden in her sketchbook, waiting to be brought to life.

Outside, a tram bell clanged faintly down Brunswick Street. The house seemed to listen, but offered nothing back.

---

Night pressed heavy on the townhouse.

Tram bells faint in the distance, then gone.  
The windows held nothing but their own reflection.

Jacob snored softly, one arm flung across the sheets. The glow of his laptop still lingered in the room, screen dark but humming.

Chel lay awake beside him, eyes fixed on the ceiling. The silence was sharp, almost brittle. She thought of the lab across the city. Samples sealed away in glass. Maybe already dividing. She prayed without words, lips barely moving.

Then—

A sound.

Thin. Trembling.

_A newborn’s cry_, drifting faintly through the townhouse.

Chel froze. Her breath caught in her throat.

It threaded closer, rising, falling. Not from the street. Not from the neighbours. *From inside.*

The cry paused. Silence rushed in again, louder than before. Chel’s skin prickled. She turned her head toward the doorway, the crack of shadow just visible.

The sound came again. Louder. Right outside their room now.

Jacob stirred, rolled onto his side, snore catching before steadying again. Unmoved.

Chel gripped the edge of the blanket. Her heart hammered so hard it filled her ears. She wanted to wake him. But her mouth stayed closed.

The crying cut off, sudden.

Silence poured back into the house.

Only Jacob’s snore remained, steady, unbroken.

Chel lay rigid, staring at the door. She didn’t breathe for a long time.

Finally she turned on her side, facing away, pressing herself into the edge of the mattress as if the wall could shield her.

Her eyes burned with sleeplessness. Her arms ached with emptiness.

The last cry echoed in her mind. It had wavered at the end, almost breaking into a giggle. *Almost*.

Chel shut her eyes tight. She told herself it was nothing, only nerves. But still—she felt the house holding its breath, as though something waited in the dark beyond the door.

Morning light spilled across the townhouse, pale and cool. Chel sat at the dining table, laptop open, a plate of untouched toast beside her.

Her parents’ faces filled the screen. Isabel smiling, Rodrigo upright beside her, arms folded but eyes warm. Behind them hung a crucifix, small but clear, casting its shadow across the wall.

“Anak,” Isabel said, “you look tired. Are you eating?”

Chel managed a small smile. “I’m fine, Mama. Just busy.”

Her father leaned in, voice steady. “And how is Jacob? Still working too hard?”

Chel’s smile tightened. “Always.”

They chuckled softly, but the sound stung.

Then Isabel’s eyes softened further. “We pray for you both every night. For good health. For… grandchildren.” Her tone was gentle, but the word hung heavy. “When will we meet our apo, anak?”

Chel swallowed hard. Her throat burned. She glanced at the plate of toast, then away. “We’re… trying, Mama.” Her voice barely carried.

Isabel nodded, still smiling. “Yes. In God’s time. Remember, anak—life is always a gift.”

Chel’s eyes blurred. She looked down quickly, forcing her breath steady.

Behind her, Jacob appeared, collared shirt open at the neck, coffee in hand. He hovered just out of the frame, watching. His shoulders taut, jaw set.

Rodrigo’s gaze shifted. “Jacob, good morning. Kumusta ka dyan?”

Jacob lifted his mug in greeting, voice flat. “Morning Pa. Early call, I’ll let you finish.” He turned away before they could answer.

Chel felt the heat rise in her face. She wiped her eye quickly with the back of her hand, forcing her smile back on for her mother.

Isabel reached toward the screen, as if to touch her. “We love you, anak. Tell Jacob also. And remember—we are praying.”

The call ended. The screen went dark, reflecting only Chel’s face, pale and tired, the untouched toast beside her.

She sat still for a long moment. Then closed the laptop softly, as though it were fragile.

---

Evening settled. The townhouse glowed with soft light. The dining table stretched long and bare except for two plates, two glasses, a bottle of wine open between them.

Chel moved quietly, setting food down with careful hands. Jacob sat already, scrolling his phone, thumb moving quick. He set it aside only when she sat opposite.

They ate in silence, the scrape of cutlery loud against porcelain.

Chel sipped her wine, then spoke, voice soft. “Mama asked again today.”

Jacob didn’t look up. “They always ask.”

The words dropped flat between them. Chel set her fork down. “She said life is a gift.”

Jacob’s jaw tightened. He reached for his glass, staring into the dark red. “We’re doing what we can.”

Chel waited for more, but nothing came. She looked at him, but he didn’t lift his eyes. The silence stretched.

Finally she rose, collecting the plates before either was finished. She carried them to the sink, water rushing as she rinsed them clean.

Behind her, Jacob swirled the wine in his glass, watching the liquid climb the sides. He didn’t drink.

Chel’s hands trembled under the tap. She shut the water off and stood still, staring at the empty plates stacked in the basin.

Jacob leaned back in his chair, gaze fixed on the glass in his hand, as though something in its depths demanded his attention.

The air between them felt heavy, unmoving.

Chel turned, drying her hands. “Do you ever wonder—” She stopped. Shook her head. “Never mind.”

Jacob finally looked up. For a moment it seemed he might speak. Instead he tipped the last of the wine into his glass, drained it in one swallow, and set it down with a muted thud.

Chel lowered her eyes.

The townhouse was silent again. The table stretched long and empty between them, as though it belonged to strangers.

---

The night was still. Tram bells had faded long ago, the street outside sunk into silence.

Chel stirred awake with a weight in her arms. She rocked it gently, still half dreaming. A sour-sweet smell clung to it, faint as spoiled milk.

Her eyes opened. It was only a blanket, damp and cold.

The blanket slipped from her grasp, collapsing to empty fabric.

A sound followed.

Creak. Slow. Steady.

Chel turned her head toward the corner.

There, faint in the streetlight glow, **a cradle rocked**. Pale wood. Thin bars. The same cradle she had sketched with trembling hands. But here it was wrong—too sharp, too thin, as though the page had bled into the dark and birthed it misshapen.

Her throat tightened. A whisper escaped before she could stop it.

“Anak…”

**Then the cry came.**

Thin at first. Then sharper. Jagged. A baby’s cry, but bent at the edges, as though the throat making it was twisted wrong.

Chel froze. Her chest heaved, but no sound left her.

Something stirred inside the cradle. Small. Hunched. A shape sat up, head too large, shoulders bent.

Chel’s breath hitched. She watched, powerless, as the figure turned — slowly, deliberately — its shadowed face shifting toward her.

Her eyes clamped shut. She pressed the blanket to her chest, praying the vision would vanish.

The crying cut off.

Silence rushed in.

Chel forced her eyes open.

The corner was bare. The cradle gone.

Beside her, Jacob snored softly, unmoved.

Chel lay rigid, staring at the emptiness where it had been. Her arms ached with the weight she no longer held.

She pressed herself closer to Jacob, eyes wide, unable to close them again.
