**Aswang – Part I: Echoes in the Earth**

---

The air was thick with dust and memory.

When the van turned off the narrow concrete road and onto the gravel path toward the village, Anna pressed her forehead against the window. Trees leaned in—acacia, coconut, the low sweep of madre de cacao branches tracing the roof with their shadows. The house had not changed much, but it had sunk. The paint faded, the steps uneven, the iron grill on the front window bent slightly at the corner.

Biana’s house.

Her Lola’s house.

Anna’s chest tightened—not grief exactly, but something with its teeth in grief. Beneath her hand, her belly fluttered. The baby, almost six months along, stirred as if sensing the shift.

Miguel said nothing, just parked and got out to start unloading their bags. He moved with quiet precision, efficient as ever. They hadn’t spoken much during the last stretch of the drive—part fatigue, part mutual caution. The land was older than either of them, and it seemed to be listening.

At the door stood Tatay Lito, Anna’s uncle. He looked smaller than she remembered—leaner, greyer, but still upright. He wore a collared shirt tucked into his faded slacks, and a rosary was coiled loosely in his left hand, as natural as breath.

“Anak,” he said, smiling gently. “You came.”

Anna stepped forward, trying to find something between guilt and comfort. “Hi, Tito.”

He looked at her belly, then into her eyes. “Your lola would be so happy to see you home.”

She didn’t know what to say. They embraced—awkwardly, briefly.

Inside, the house smelled of wood polish, dried herbs, and something sweet and aged, like old missals left too long in sunlight. The altar near the window was draped in white cloth, with framed images of the Sacred Heart and Our Lady of Sorrows flanking a flickering candle. Fresh sampaguita garlands hung limply from the crucifix above.

That night, the novena prayers began.

They gathered in the sala, chairs pulled into a semicircle, some kneeling, others murmuring in singsong cadence. The voices were soft but certain. Miguel stood near the back, hands clasped behind him, respectful but detached. Anna sat beside her uncle, her eyes downcast.

She remembered these prayers vaguely—her mother’s voice, hands folded beside her at bedtime. It had been years. Teresa would light candles every Saturday and whisper a Hail Mary at red lights. It was all background then. Now, it felt like an inheritance she’d misplaced.

When the mysteries were done, an older woman—Tiya Nena—began passing out rice cakes and tsokolate in little enamel cups. Conversation resumed in the flicker of candles and murmurs of fans creaking overhead. Someone brought up the heat, someone else the state of the roads. Then came the stories.

It began innocuously—talk of strange dreams, a neighbor’s cat mewling at night, chickens missing from their pens.

Then the old rhyme:

> “She walks without feet  
> and eats what you keep  
> in cribs and in cradles  
> when mothers don’t sleep.”

The room shifted. Not with fear, exactly. With recognition.

“You know,” said Manong Pedro, lowering his voice, “when I was young, we shot a cat in the foot. The next day, Aling Purita had a limp. Swore it was rheumatism. But she never came to the chapel again.”

Laughter broke out—half-nervous, half-playful. But some eyes glanced toward the window. The moon was low. The balete tree across the street cast long, twisted shadows.

“It’s just stories,” Miguel said, voice low but audible. “Folklore. Every culture has its boogeyman.”

Tatay Lito looked at him, then at Anna. “Your lola knew. She didn’t speak of these things lightly.”

Anna folded her hands over her belly. She didn’t believe in monsters. But her mother used to say that some stories weren’t meant to scare—they were meant to remember.

She thought of how Teresa would pause outside every old church to whisper a prayer. Of how she’d press a small medal into Anna’s pocket before exams, saying, “You don’t need to believe. Just keep it close.”

Anna’s eyes wandered to the altar. The flame danced. A breeze stirred the edge of the white cloth.

Later that night, after the guests had gone, she explored the house quietly. Miguel was already in bed, asleep with one arm over his eyes. Lito was outside, lighting a stick of incense and praying under his breath. Anna entered her grandmother’s room, half-curious, half-led.

It smelled faintly of oil and lavender.

Her eyes settled on a wooden statue of Our Lady of Sorrows near the bed, paint chipped at the hem of the robe, but lovingly kept. She lifted it gently. Something shifted in the hollow base.

Inside, wrapped in linen and bound with red thread, was a small brass disk.

A reliquary.

Alongside it, a note in Lola Biana’s spidery handwriting:

> _“He will cover you with His pinions, and under His wings you will find refuge; His faithfulness is a shield and buckler.  
> You will not fear the terror of the night.”_  
> —Psalm 91:4–5

Anna sat down slowly, holding the relic like a weight in her hands.

She didn’t know why, but tears came.

**Aswang – Part I (continued): The Midwife Returns**

---

The next morning came hot and slow.

Roosters called before the sun had fully risen, and the village stirred to life as if it had always been awake. Miguel took a walk to stretch his back and check on the hire van—he returned dusty, annoyed at the potholes, muttering something about the suspension. Tatay Lito swept the yard with the quiet rhythm of someone who had done so for decades. Anna stayed inside, her limbs heavy, her dreams from the night before still clinging like mist.

There had been… something. A sound. Breathing that wasn’t hers. A woman whispering, just outside the door. Or maybe it was the trees.

She didn’t tell Miguel.

Around midmorning, while Anna was folding some of her grandmother’s old linens in the sala, there came a knock at the door—three soft taps, spaced evenly. Not the hurried knock of a neighbor or family member. Measured. Gentle.

Tatay Lito looked up from his reading. His hand paused over the rosary. He stood.

“Stay inside,” he said, and went to answer.

But the woman at the door was all smiles.

“Lito,” she said warmly, in the lilting Ilonggo of the older generation. “I heard the children had returned.”

Her voice was like warm broth—soft, fragrant, and thick. She wore a faded pink blouse with embroidery at the collar, her hair tied neatly at the nape. She could have been in her sixties, maybe older, but her skin was smooth in the way polished stone is smooth—ageless, without detail.

Aling Belen.

Anna had heard her name already from one of the neighbors—“still helping the village,” they said, “the only midwife left now.” Her presence came with respect, as if she belonged to the land.

“I brought some things,” Belen continued, lifting a small basket. “Just a few herbs. Something to ease pregnancy pains. And tea to help with sleep.”

Anna stepped into view. Belen’s eyes found her and softened further, smile widening as if delighted.

“You must be Anna,” she said. “You look like your mother.”

Anna nodded, uneasy. “Thank you, po. That’s kind of you.”

“Your lola,” Belen said, voice lowering into something close to reverence, “was a pillar. A good woman. I miss her prayers.”

Lito said nothing.

They sat her down for a short while. She refused water but accepted a seat. Miguel emerged from the back, nodded politely, and stood beside Anna with folded arms. Belen's gaze settled on him, then drifted to Anna’s belly.

“Ah,” she said, drawing in a slow breath. “Six months?”

“Nearly,” Anna replied.

Belen reached out—too suddenly—and laid a hand lightly over Anna’s stomach. The touch was cool. Firm. Not unkind, but lingering a moment longer than necessary.

“Strong child,” she murmured. “Very strong. Your womb is full of light.”

Anna blinked.

“Forgive me,” Belen said, pulling her hand back. “Old habit. I’ve helped bring in more babies than I can count. The women here trust me more than they trust doctors.”

“We’ve been seeing someone in Perth,” Miguel said, tone flat.

“Of course. Of course,” Belen smiled. “Still, if you need anything while you’re here, just call. I’ll bring you something gentle for the nights.”

She stood. The air felt thinner as she moved toward the door. “Let your lola rest easy. And you,” she said, eyes back on Anna’s belly, “take care not to sleep too deeply.”

A pause.

“The night can be very long here.”

Then she was gone.

---

Tatay Lito stood for a while after she left, eyes fixed on the threshold as if something had brushed it.

“She used to apprentice under your lola,” he said at last. “Before she disappeared.”

Anna turned to him. “Disappeared?”

He nodded. “Many years ago. Then came back. Not a wrinkle on her.”

Miguel scoffed softly. “What, you think she’s a vampire?”

“No,” said Lito. “I think she hides something worse.”

Anna frowned. “She just seemed… intense.”

“She was polite,” Miguel added. “A bit odd, maybe, but—”

“Your lola knew,” Lito said, then said no more.

---

That night, Anna opened the packet of herbs Belen had left on the kitchen table. It smelled faintly of lemongrass and something metallic. She hesitated. Then folded it shut and placed it back into the basket, untouched.

She locked the windows. She double-checked the back door. And when she finally lay down to sleep beside Miguel, she placed the tiny relic beneath her pillow.

In the dark, something rustled on the roof.

**Aswang – Part I (continued): What the Elders Whisper**

---

The second night, the novena was thinner.

Only a handful came. Some lit candles. Some prayed distractedly. Most were gone before the final mystery. The air felt heavier—not in grief, but in the quiet way animals stop moving before an earthquake.

Anna sat in the dim sala again, this time beside her younger cousin, Tinay, a girl of maybe nine or ten who fidgeted through the prayers and swung her legs. She had a plastic bracelet with little images of saints on it, worn smooth from use.

“You don’t live here, no?” the girl whispered while Lito led the Litany.

Anna smiled faintly. “We live in Australia now.”

Tinay nodded seriously, as if that confirmed something for her. “It’s safer there.”

“Why do you say that?”

The girl leaned closer. “Because the woman with no feet doesn’t go there.”

Anna blinked. “What?”

Tinay looked toward the window, then back. “She walks here. You can hear her nails tapping on the bamboo floors. But you won’t see her legs. Just the shadow of her hair.”

Miguel, seated across the room, looked up.

“She goes from house to house,” Tinay went on. “Sniffing.”

“For what?”

“For babies,” she whispered. “Or the ones not yet born.”

Anna’s throat went dry.

“She licks the belly button,” Tinay added, “and if the mother isn’t blessed, the baby forgets how to breathe.”

Anna said nothing. A candle flickered violently beside the altar.

---

Later, when the guests had gone and the crickets reclaimed the silence, Tatay Lito poured Miguel a bit of lambanog and sat out on the veranda. Anna sat nearby, her feet propped on a stool, listening but not speaking.

“The rhyme is old,” Lito said, swirling his cup. “From my father’s time. Maybe before.”

Miguel shook his head. “It’s children’s stories. Meant to keep them from wandering.”

Lito raised an eyebrow. “You think stories don’t come from truth?”

There was a pause.

“I’ve heard versions of it all my life,” he continued. “Aswang who wear the faces of your friends. Who walk like people, but whose shadows crawl the walls. Who can split their bodies in two and leave their legs behind.”

“That’s ridiculous,” Miguel muttered.

“Maybe,” Lito said. “But still, no one walks alone past midnight. No one hangs laundry after dark. You notice?” He gestured toward the empty lines strung between trees.

Anna had.

“No one buries kin near the balete trees,” he added. “No one eats guava at dusk. And everyone keeps garlic on the windowsill—if not for belief, then out of respect.”

“Respect for what?” Miguel challenged.

Lito looked at him—long and level. “For the things that remember blood. And want it back.”

---

Anna didn’t speak until they were alone again in the bedroom. She sat on the edge of the bed, slowly massaging oil into her stomach.

“Did your parents ever talk about things like this?” she asked.

Miguel shook his head. “My dad didn’t even want a crucifix in the house. Said we should put our faith in reason. Science.”

“And your mum?”

“She lit candles when he wasn’t looking,” he said quietly.

Anna smiled a little. Then sighed.

“I don’t think I believe it either,” she admitted. “But… I don’t know. This place makes me feel like I’ve forgotten something.”

She glanced toward her bag, where she’d tucked away the reliquary. Just holding it made her chest ache. Not with fear. With homesickness. But not for Perth. Not even for her mother.

It was something older. Something wordless. Like the way Lola Biana used to hum while cooking, or the smell of candles on Sunday morning even when they didn’t go to Mass.

She lay back and turned toward Miguel, who was already half-asleep.

Outside, a dog howled once.

In the distance, another answered—but with a sound that ended too abruptly.

Like it had been cut off.

---

**Aswang – Part I (continued): Things That Watch**

---

The dream was strange, but not unfamiliar.

Anna stood in the middle of a rice field under a deep indigo sky, windless and wrong. The stalks around her were dry, brittle, clicking like teeth in the absence of breeze. Her hands were pressed against her stomach, heavy with the child, but something inside her moved—not the usual flutter. A turning. A deliberate shifting.

She looked down.

There was a face pressed against the skin of her belly, just beneath the surface. Smiling.

Its mouth opened.

She woke with a gasp.

Beside her, Miguel stirred but didn’t wake. The fan spun lazily on the ceiling. A gecko chirped from the wall. Everything was as it should be.

Except for the scratching.

Faint, at first—like nails dragging along wood. It came from beneath the floorboards, beneath the house.

Anna sat up. The scratching stopped.

She held her breath. Waited.

Silence.

Then a faint _thud_—something small dropping from the roof. Or climbing.

She stood carefully, went to the window, and peeked between the slats. The moon was hidden behind clouds. The trees across the road swayed as though something had passed through them, but there was no breeze.

A cat stared back at her from the fence post. White, with one blue eye and one clouded grey. It didn’t blink. Just watched.

Then it opened its mouth and hissed—a long, dry sound—without moving its body.

Anna stepped back and shut the curtain.

---

The next morning, she found long, thin footprints in the soft earth behind the house. Not barefoot, not shoes. Almost… birdlike. But heavier.

Miguel examined them with a frown. “Probably just a stray dog,” he offered.

She didn’t answer. She didn’t think dogs had two toes.

---

That afternoon, she walked to the chapel with Tatay Lito.

It sat at the edge of the village, stone-walled and quiet, the crucifix above the door weathered but dignified. Inside, candles burned low before faded icons. The air smelled of old wax and ash.

Anna sat in the pews while Lito replaced flowers at the altar.

“You know,” he said after a time, not looking at her, “your lola used to say the devils don’t mind if you stop believing in them. It just makes the work easier.”

Anna smiled weakly. “That’s comforting.”

“She meant it in reverse, I think. Even if you don’t believe, grace still works.”

She ran her fingers over the pew’s edge. “Do you believe what they say? About Belen?”

He paused.

“I didn’t,” he said. “Not when my mother was still alive. Thought she was being paranoid.”

“And now?”

Now he looked at her.

“I think she was the last one praying loud enough to be heard.”

---

That night, Anna found an envelope tucked under her bedroom door. No name. No writing. Just a folded piece of paper and a pressed flower—dried and blackened at the edges.

Inside, in an old woman’s script:

> _If you feel something breathing on your belly while you sleep, don’t move._  
> _Don’t speak. Don’t open your eyes._  
> _She only takes what she’s noticed._  
> _Pretend not to notice her._

Anna stared at the note for a long time.

She slept that night with the reliquary clutched in one hand, tucked beneath her pillow. And though her dreams came again—this time of a woman standing at the door with no eyes—she did not wake to find her watching.

Only the cat. Still on the fence. Still staring.

But now it limped.

---

**Aswang – Part I (continued): The Visit with No Herbs**

---

It was two days before the funeral.

The sun hung low in the west, casting gold across the dusty road when Aling Belen returned—this time without warning, without basket, and without smile.

Anna had been sitting on the porch, her feet resting in a basin of cool water, absently thumbing her mother’s old rosary. The beads were worn smooth, the crucifix darkened with time and touch. She wasn’t praying. Not really. Just… holding it. Like muscle memory.

She almost didn’t notice Belen walking up the path.

No footsteps.

Just the faintest shift in shadow.

“Magandang hapon, hija,” the woman said, suddenly there at the foot of the steps. She wore the same faded pink blouse as before, but her hair was down today, long and unnaturally black. There were no leaves caught in it. No sweat on her brow, despite the heat.

Anna stood awkwardly, instinctively tucking the rosary into her pocket. “Hello po. I wasn’t expecting—”

“No herbs today,” Belen interrupted softly. “Just checking in.”

She mounted the steps with the grace of someone decades younger and sat beside Anna uninvited. Her hands folded delicately in her lap.

“How is the child?” she asked.

Anna hesitated. “Active.”

Belen’s smile did not reach her eyes. “That’s good. The active ones survive.”

A long pause.

“I’ve been dreaming,” Belen said quietly. “Of a bird flying into a womb. Nesting. Stirring the blood. Old dreams. They come when something is about to be born.”

Anna didn’t reply.

“You know,” Belen continued, “not all life comes the same way. Some are breathed into, some are spoken. And some are… _given._ Like inheritance.”

She turned suddenly, eyes sharp now—too sharp.

“You ever wonder what your lola passed on?”

Anna swallowed. “She left us a few things.”

Belen tilted her head. “She left us many things.”

Another silence stretched, then frayed.

Belen reached out again, hand hovering near Anna’s stomach—but this time, Anna stepped back.

“I think I need to rest now.”

The woman’s eyes glinted. Not in anger, but something colder. Amused, maybe. Or hungry.

“Of course,” she said, rising without effort. “You must care for what’s growing. The nights are long here.”

She turned to leave, but before stepping off the porch, she paused.

“If you ever feel a breeze pass through the house, even when the windows are shut,” she said lightly, “don’t chase it. It’s not leaving.”

And then she walked back the way she came—except Anna never heard her footsteps once.

---

Inside, Miguel found her sitting at the kitchen table, pale and quiet.

“What happened?”

“Belen came by.”

Miguel frowned. “Again?”

“She said strange things.”

“Stranger than the tea?”

Anna looked up. “She knows something.”

Miguel sat beside her. “Maybe she’s just old and nosy. You know how people get when they don’t have anything to do.”

Anna didn’t respond.

She didn’t mention how Belen’s skin didn’t seem to wrinkle when she moved. Or how the shadows behind her didn’t quite match the angle of the sun. Or how, just before she left, the rosary in her pocket had grown warm. Not hot. Not burning.

Just warm. Like it was warning her.

---

**Aswang – Part I (continued): The Funeral**

---

The Mass was held in the village chapel, small and open-air, with cracked floor tiles and crooked ceiling fans that stirred more dust than breeze. The old priest from the next barangay presided—Fr. Ramil, stooped with age, voice thin but steady.

The coffin was modest, pale wood with a plain white veil draped over it. A rosary wound around Lola Biana’s folded hands, and a small statue of Our Lady of Sorrows rested at her feet. Someone had laid sampaguita garlands over the lid, their sweetness wilting in the heat.

Anna stood in the front pew with Miguel beside her. She hadn’t cried. Not when they’d dressed her lola’s body. Not when they’d sat through the wake. Not even when they’d prayed the novena. But now, as the priest spoke of “those who fall asleep in the hope of the resurrection,” something in her chest throbbed.

Her hand moved to her belly without thinking.

Hope.

She used to think that word meant something sentimental. Her mother had said it often—when the cancer returned, when the chemo failed. “We hope,” she’d whispered in the hospice room, holding Anna’s hand. “Even when we don’t understand.”

Anna had nodded, then. But in her heart, she hadn’t believed.

She remembered yelling in the car on the way home after Teresa died. Miguel had driven. She had sat in silence for an hour, then finally exploded. “She prayed every night,” she’d said. “She kept the rosary in the glovebox. Lit candles like they meant something. And she still died choking on her own breath.”

Miguel had said nothing. He’d only gripped the steering wheel tighter.

Now, standing in the pew with sweat tracing down her spine, she realized something: it wasn’t that her mother’s faith had failed.

It was that Anna had never inherited it.

---

After the burial, they returned to the house for a simple meal. Tinola. Rice. Brewed salabat in sweating pitchers.

The mood was subdued. Some of the villagers chatted quietly; others kept glancing at the trees beyond the backyard, as if waiting for someone.

Anna slipped away to the back of the house, where Tatay Lito stood alone, looking toward the old garden where his mother used to keep basil and guava.

“She loved this spot,” he said, not turning. “She’d sit there when the sun was low and pray.”

Anna stepped beside him. “She never pushed it on us. The faith, I mean.”

“No,” Lito said. “She didn’t need to.”

He looked at Anna now, his expression unreadable.

“She believed it would find you when the time was right.”

Anna looked down. “I don’t know if I believe in anything.”

“Belief isn’t a switch,” he said. “It’s a seed. Sometimes it waits in the dark.”

The wind moved the leaves slightly. The rustle sounded almost like a whisper.

Anna blinked hard. “She died alone.”

“No,” he said. “She died praying.”

Silence again. Then Anna asked, without knowing why:

“Do you think… something took her?”

Lito didn’t answer for a long time. When he did, it was a whisper.

“I think she faced something. And she chose not to be afraid.”

---

That night, Anna dreamed again.

She was back in the field, only now the sky was darker. The moon pulsed red behind thick clouds. The face in her belly was gone, but the air smelled of copper and earth. Something crouched at the edge of the field, just out of sight.

It was humming.

Her mother’s voice.

But slowed. Warped. Not quite human.

When she woke, the room was cold.

The windows were shut.

But the candle at the altar was lit—though no one had touched it.

And the relic beneath her pillow was warm again.
