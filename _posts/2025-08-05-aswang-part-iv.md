**Aswang – Part IV: The First Call**  
_“The serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field…”_
_(Genesis 3:1)_

---

The afternoon light filtered soft and amber through the woven curtains.

Anna moved slowly around the bedroom, putting things back where they belonged—half from habit, half from the ache of needing to keep busy. The relic had been placed carefully on the bedside altar, wrapped once more in Biana’s cloth. Four candles ringed it in saucers of salt, their wicks trimmed, unlit for now.

She found it behind the altar, tucked behind an old _Libro de Santa Misa_, its leather cover brittle with age.

Not a letter.

A **journal**.

Handwritten in Biana’s careful, looping script. Pages filled with herbs, novena schedules, reflections on the village births.

But near the end, the ink grew heavier. Lines crossed out. Smudged.

Anna flipped carefully until she found an entry dated just a few months before her death.

> _She came again today. Still no grey in her hair. Still the same soft voice._  
> _She brings food, herbs. But the children she delivers are quieter than they should be._
> 
> _I see Mira watching the mothers. Her eyes are too old for her face._  
> _I tried to warn Lito. He smiled and said I needed to rest._
> 
> _Lord, if I am wrong, forgive me._  
> _But if I am right… let someone be ready._
> 
> _I keep the relic hidden now. In case I grow too weak to speak aloud._
> 
> _I light a candle for Anna every Sunday. She’s far, but the Lord is farther and still hears me._
> 
> _If I don’t see her again, may the angels bring her comfort. I don’t know if she believes anymore._  
> _But belief is a gift. Sometimes it skips a generation. But the flame can still catch._

Anna stopped reading.

Her throat closed.

She touched the edge of the page. It smelled faintly of candle wax and bay leaf.

“I’m here, Lola,” she whispered. “I’m here now.”

---

Outside, Miguel called to her—his voice low, alarmed.

She stepped outside and followed him toward the back window.

He pointed.

The salt line was broken.

A single **bare footprint**, long and delicate, marred the white arc.

Too small for Miguel. Too wrong for a child.

Anna stared at it. The wind had died. The air pressed in like a held breath.

She felt something shift in her belly. Not pain. Not a kick.

Something deeper.

Watching.

Miguel swore softly and fetched more salt. He didn’t wait. He repaired the breach, slow and careful.

And from the shadows of the tree line…

**Mira watched.**

No expression.

Just hunger. Or maybe longing.

When their eyes met, she turned and walked into the dark.

---

They gathered in the sala just after dusk.

No one needed to say why.

Miguel finished laying the last of the salt line. Anna lit the candles at the four corners again. And Lito, after locking the door with trembling fingers, took a worn wooden chair and sat with his hands folded over a small bottle of holy water.

He looked older tonight.

But his eyes were clear.

“We’ve waited long enough,” he said. “You need to know what we’re facing.”

The candlelight trembled slightly.

---

“I didn’t believe my mother at first,” he began. “I thought it was grief talking. Belen had returned, yes—but people return. Strange doesn’t mean cursed.”

He paused. Rubbed the corner of his eye.

“But then the stillbirths started. Quiet ones. No mourning. No questions. Some mothers grew pale. Distant. Some disappeared altogether.”

He looked at Anna.

“Your lola confronted her. Not publicly. Not dramatically. She waited until Mira wasn’t around and then went to Belen’s house.”

“What happened?” Miguel asked.

“I don’t know exactly. I only heard the scream.”

A silence settled.

“I ran. Found her at the foot of the stairs. The angle of her neck… it wasn’t natural.”

Anna shivered.

“I told myself she fell. That made it easier. But when I carried her body back here, her fingers were burned. Like she’d held something red-hot just before death.”

He gestured toward the altar.

“The relic.”

---

Miguel sat forward. “And Belen?”

“Untouched. Unbothered. She came to the wake. Wept like a daughter.”

Lito’s voice cracked.

“That was when I knew. I just didn’t know the name for it.”

He looked up now.

“But I do.”

---

“They’re called **aswang**. Not the kind in stories—fangs and wings. The real ones don’t always change shape. Some never leave their bodies. Some don’t even feed often. They wait. They hollow out. And then… they take.”

He reached into his pocket and produced a small pouch. Opened it. Inside: dark ashes, salt, and dried petals.

“The oldest ones don’t just hunger for blood. They want **inheritance**. They pass on the curse the way a parent might pass on land. Or a name.”

He met Anna’s eyes now.

“It’s called the **pasa**.”

She whispered it back. “Pasa.”

“It means ‘to pass’ or ‘to hand over.’ A rite. At death, the aswang doesn’t die. It expels something. Some say it’s a creature. Some say a stone. Some say a lump of flesh.”

“And Mira,” Miguel said.

Lito nodded. “She’s been prepared. Groomed. Belen’s apprentice. But the rite requires something more.”

He turned to Anna now.

“Your child.”

Miguel stood abruptly. “No. No, she’s not getting near her.”

“She doesn’t need to,” Lito said softly. “She only needs to **claim** the child. To bind it spiritually. Through fear. Through blood. Or…”

He trailed off.

“…through invitation.”

Anna paled. “She tried. She came in my mother’s voice.”

Lito nodded slowly. “They don’t always break in. Sometimes they’re _let_ in.”

---

A sound cut through the silence.

A **low tap-tap-tap** on the bamboo slats of the wall.

Rhythmic.

Like fingernails.

Anna clutched her belly. The relic burned faintly against her skin.

The lights flickered.

Lito stood and moved to the altar. “We hold the line tonight,” he said. “No matter what form she takes.”

Miguel took up the bottle of holy water.

Anna began the first Hail Mary she had said aloud in years.

> _“Hail Mary, full of grace…”_

From the window—

A whisper.

> _“Anak… open the door… it’s Mama…”_

The candles flared violently.

The relic _burned hot_.

And from beneath the front door, **black smoke** began to curl inward, tendrils reaching like fingers.

---

Miguel stepped forward and flung the holy water down.

> _“In the name of Jesus Christ, be gone.”_

The smoke hissed. Retreated.

And in the darkness, they heard her voice again—calm, maternal, **starving**:

> _“You can’t keep what was never blessed.”_

Then silence.

---

The candles steadied.

The salt line held.

For now.

But Lito’s face was pale. And his voice was grim.

> “That was not a visit. That was the first call of the rite.”

---

**“I didn’t believe her at first,”** Lito said. His voice was low, but steady—like he was finally letting a stone fall from his hands.  
“Ma would say things in her last years. She was gentle, always, but there was a change. She prayed more. Slept less. She watched Belen like she was waiting for something.”

He exhaled.

“She was.”

Anna and Miguel sat on the edge of the woven sofa. The baby was quiet inside her, but her palms were damp, her pulse ticking behind her ears.

“What is Belen?” Miguel asked, already knowing the answer, already bracing against it.

Lito looked directly at him.

> “She’s **aswang**.”

---

He let the word sit in the room.

Anna felt the old stories flare up from childhood—long tongues, flying torsos, intestines like black vines—but this didn’t feel like that. It felt… smaller. Closer. Like Belen had been slowly stepping across a line none of them could see.

“She didn’t always show it,” Lito said. “They never do. But she stopped aging long ago. And babies born in her care—some didn’t cry. Some didn’t survive. There was a year when every child she touched came sick.”

He turned to Anna.

“Your lola started keeping a list. Quietly. The names. The mothers. Who lived. Who didn’t.”

Anna swallowed. “And Mira?”

Lito nodded. “Taken in as an orphan. Raised with no baptism. No sacraments. Nothing holy in that home.”

He paused. Looked toward the door, then back.

“I think Belen’s dying. Whatever sustains her—it’s running thin. And she needs to pass it on.”

Miguel tensed. “Pass what on?”

Lito closed his eyes briefly.

> “The **pasa**. A spiritual inheritance. Demonic, parasitic. When an aswang dies, she regurgitates… something. Some say it’s a creature. Some say a stone. Some say a lump of blood, still warm.”

> “It must be _swallowed_. Received. Chosen.”

> “If it’s accepted, the power continues. The hunger continues.”

Anna felt a deep cold settle behind her ribs.

“She’s grooming Mira to take it,” Lito said. “But the ritual won’t work unless it’s rooted in a birth. A… mockery of baptism. A perverse rite of blood and flesh.”

“And that’s why she wants—” Miguel stopped, voice caught in his throat.

Anna placed a hand on her belly.

Lito nodded.

> “She wants your child to be part of the inheritance. Not devoured—_claimed_. Twisted into the ritual. Consecrated to darkness.”

Silence.

Then Lito added, almost in a whisper:

> “Your mother was taken too. Not by death. By silence. By thinking these things were just stories.  
> Your lola died _fighting_. She didn’t fall.  
> She confronted Belen—alone. And she paid for it.”

---

The candle at the center of the altar flickered wildly.

Miguel stood.

“What do we do?”

Lito looked at him.

And for the first time, smiled—not with joy, but with recognition.

> “Now,” he said, standing slowly, “we **pray**. And we prepare.”

---

Outside, something scraped along the tin roof.

Then silence.

Then:

A soft, high **whisper**, just outside the window.

A woman’s voice. Familiar.

**“Anak... let me in. It’s Mama. I brought your old blanket. You’re cold, aren’t you?”**

Anna’s lips parted.

It was **Teresa’s voice**.

Her mother’s voice.

Her hands trembled.

Lito grabbed her wrist—firmly.

“It’s not her,” he said. “It _uses_ memory. It speaks in longing.”

Miguel was already at the window, holding the holy water.

He looked out.

Saw nothing.

But then, for the briefest moment, **a long hand pressed against the glass**.

Not clawed. Not monstrous.

Just pale.

Too pale.

Then it melted back into the dark.

---

Miguel turned to Lito.  
“Will it stop?”

Lito shook his head.

> “No.  
> It’s only begun.”

---

#### **Belen - Bungtod, 1967**

---

It began after the blood wouldn’t stop.

Belen was seventeen when the village turned from her.

The mother had died on the mat. A young wife—her first child. It came breech, and Belen didn’t know what to do. She called for Biana too late. By the time the old midwife arrived, there was already silence in the womb.

They buried the girl that afternoon.

The family never spoke to Belen again.

Even Biana, who had once held her hands in prayer, said nothing—only pressed her lips into a thin line and began locking the herb cabinet at night.

So Belen left.

She packed a satchel, stole three boiled eggs from the kitchen, and walked into the mountains with her shame coiled like smoke in her lungs.

---

It was there, halfway between hunger and grief, that she met the woman.

She had no name—at least, not one Belen remembered.

She lived in a hut between two balete trees, where no birds sang and no frogs called at night. Her skin was like dried bark, her hair long and slick like wet thread. Her eyes were nearly all black.

But her voice… it was sweet.

So sweet.

> “They cast you out,” the woman said. “But not because you failed. Because you reminded them that they could.”

Belen wept like a child. The woman did not comfort her.

She offered her tea.

> “They think life is given,” she said, “but it can be taken. Shaped. Bent to the hand.”

> “Birth is not sacred. It is a gate. And gates can be owned.”

Belen stayed one week. Then two.

The dreams began in the third.

She dreamed of children with empty eyes.

Of blood that whispered.

Of a crying that never ended, only sank lower and lower, into the earth.

---

One night, the woman fell ill. Her breathing grew ragged. Her voice faded.

And then, on the seventh evening, she called Belen to her mat.

No words.

Only a heaving sound—deep, guttural, like something crawling up her throat.

And then she vomited it out.

A **black mass**—round, pulsing faintly, like a heart that had forgotten how to beat. It steamed on the mat. Smelled of copper and sugar and rot.

She wrapped it in banana leaves.

Offered it to Belen.

Still no words.

Only waiting.

---

Belen held it.

She could have thrown it into the fire.

She could have fled.

But she remembered the girl who bled out in her arms.

She remembered how Biana looked at her after.

And she remembered the voice in her dreams, whispering:

> “You can stop the dying. You can own the birth.”

She placed the black mass to her lips.

And **swallowed**.

---

For three days she couldn’t speak.

The world bent around her.

She could hear the insects breathing. Smell the iron beneath the soil. And deeper still, she began to hear the unborn.

They spoke in pulses. In fears.

She returned to the village a month later.

No one remembered how old she was.

She never aged again.

---

> _“They think I bring death,”_ she once whispered to Mira. _“But I don’t. I bring a different kind of life.”_  
> _“They feed theirs with prayer. I feed mine with blood.”_  
> _“Both are hungry.”_
