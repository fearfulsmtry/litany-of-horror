**Aswang – Part IV: The First Call**  

_“The serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field…”_
_(Genesis 3:1)_

---

The afternoon light filtered soft and amber through the woven curtains.

Anna moved slowly around the bedroom, putting things back where they belonged—half from habit, half from the ache of needing to keep busy. The relic had been placed carefully on the bedside altar, wrapped once more in Biana’s cloth. Four candles ringed it in saucers of salt, their wicks trimmed, unlit for now.

She found it behind the altar, tucked behind an old _Libro de Santa Misa_, its leather cover brittle with age.

Not a letter.

A **journal**.

Handwritten in Biana’s careful, looping script. Pages filled with herbs, novena schedules, reflections on the village births.

But near the end, the ink grew heavier. Lines crossed out. Smudged.

Anna flipped carefully until she found an entry dated just a few months before her death.

> _She came again today. Still no grey in her hair. Still the same soft voice._  
> _She brings food, herbs. But the children she delivers are quieter than they should be._
> 
> _I see Mira watching the mothers. Her eyes are too old for her face._  
> _I tried to warn Lito. He smiled and said I needed to rest._
> 
> _Lord, if I am wrong, forgive me._  
> _But if I am right… let someone be ready._
> 
> _I keep the relic hidden now. In case I grow too weak to speak aloud._
> 
> _I light a candle for my dear apong Anna every Sunday. She’s far, but the Lord is farther and still hears me._
> 
> _If I don’t see her again, may the angels bring her comfort. I don’t know if she believes anymore._
> 
> _Faith is a gift. Sometimes the embers feel cold. But the flame can still catch._

Anna stopped reading.

Her throat closed.

She touched the edge of the page. It smelled faintly of candle wax and bay leaf.

“I’m here, Lola,” she whispered. “I’m here now.”

---

Outside, Miguel called to her—his voice low, alarmed.

She stepped outside and followed him toward the back window.

He pointed.

The salt line was broken.

A single **bare footprint**, long and delicate, marred the white arc.

Too small for Miguel. Too wrong for a child.

Anna stared at it. The wind had died. The air pressed in like a held breath.

She felt something shift in her belly. Not pain. Not a kick.

Something deeper.

Watching.

Miguel swore softly and fetched more salt. He didn’t wait. He repaired the breach, slow and careful.

And from the shadows of the tree line…

**Mira watched.**

No expression.

Just hunger. Or maybe longing.

When their eyes met, she turned and walked into the dark.

---

That night, they gathered in the sala.

No one needed to say why.

Miguel laid the last of the salt line. Anna lit the candles. Lito locked the door with trembling fingers and sat in the wooden chair beside the altar, holy water in his lap, eyes shadowed but steady.

“We’ve waited long enough,” he said. “You need to know what we’re facing.”

The candlelight trembled slightly.

“I didn’t believe my mother at first,” he began. “I thought it was grief talking. Belen had returned, yes—but people return. Strange doesn’t mean cursed.”

He paused. Rubbed the corner of his eye.

“But then the stillbirths started. Quiet ones. No mourning. No questions. Some mothers grew pale. Some disappeared altogether.”

He looked at Anna.

“Your lola confronted her. Not publicly. Not dramatically. She waited until Mira wasn’t around and then went to Belen’s house.”

“What happened?” Miguel asked.

“I don’t know exactly. I only heard the scream.”

A silence settled.

“I found her at the foot of the stairs. The angle of her neck… it wasn’t natural. I told myself she fell. That made it easier. But when I carried her body home, her fingers were burned. Like she’d held something red-hot just before death.”

He gestured toward the altar.

“The relic.”

Miguel sat forward. “And Belen?”

“Untouched. Unbothered. She came to the wake. Wept like a daughter.”

His voice cracked.

“That was when I knew. I just didn’t want to name it.”

He looked up now.

“But I do.”

> “She’s aswang.”

“They’re not like the stories,” he said. “Some never leave their bodies. Some don’t even feed often. They wait. They hollow out. And then… they take.”

He reached into his pocket and produced a small pouch. Opened it. Inside: ashes, salt, and dried petals.

“The oldest ones don’t just hunger for blood. They want inheritance. They pass on the curse the way a parent might pass on land. Or a name.”

He met Anna’s eyes.

“It’s called the pasa.”

He turned to Miguel.

“When an aswang dies, she regurgitates… something. Some say it’s a creature. Some say a stone. Some say a lump of flesh. It must be swallowed. Received. Chosen.”

“And Mira,” Anna said.

Lito nodded. “She’s been prepared. Raised without baptism. Taught to mock prayer. But the ritual needs more.”

He looked at her belly.

> “It needs a child. A gate. A mockery of birth.”

A sound cut through the silence.

A low tap-tap-tap on the bamboo wall.

Rhythmic.

Like fingernails.

Anna clutched her belly. The relic burned faintly against her skin.

The lights flickered.

Lito stood and moved to the altar. “We hold the line tonight,” he said. “No matter what form she takes.”

Miguel took up the bottle of holy water.

Anna began the first Hail Mary she had said aloud in years.

> “Hail Mary, full of grace…”

From the window—

A whisper.

> “Anak… open the door… it’s Mama…”

The candles flared violently.

The relic burned hot.

And from beneath the front door, black smoke began to curl inward, tendrils reaching like fingers.

Lito stepped forward and flung the holy water down.

> “In the name of Jesus Christ, be gone.”

The smoke hissed. Retreated.

And in the darkness, they heard her voice again—calm, maternal, starving:

> “You can’t keep what was never blessed.”

Then silence.

The candles steadied.

The salt line held.

For now.

But Lito’s face was pale. And his voice was grim.

> “That was not a visit.
>  That was the first call of the rite.”

#### **Belen - Bungtod, 1969**

---

It began after the blood wouldn’t stop.

Belen was seventeen when the village turned from her.

The mother had died on the mat. A young wife—her first child. It came breech, and Belen didn’t know what to do. She called for Biana too late. By the time the old midwife arrived, there was already silence in the womb.

They buried the girl that afternoon.

The family never spoke to Belen again.

Even Biana, who had once held her hands in prayer, said nothing—only pressed her lips into a thin line and began locking the herb cabinet at night.

So Belen left.

She packed a satchel, stole three boiled eggs from the kitchen, and walked into the mountains with her shame coiled like smoke in her lungs.

---

It was there, halfway between hunger and grief, that she met the woman.

She had no name—at least, not one Belen remembered.

She lived in a hut between two balete trees, where no birds sang and no frogs called at night. Her skin was like dried bark, her hair long and slick like wet thread. Her eyes were nearly all black.

But her voice… it was sweet.

So sweet.

> “They cast you out,” the woman said. “But not because you failed. Because you reminded them that they could.”

Belen wept like a child. The woman did not comfort her.

She offered her tea.

> “They think life is given,” she said, “but it can be taken. Shaped. Bent to the hand.”

> “Birth is not sacred. It is a gate. And gates can be owned.”

Belen stayed one week. Then two.

The dreams began in the third.

She dreamed of children with empty eyes.

Of blood that whispered.

Of a crying that never ended, only sank lower and lower, into the earth.

---

One night, the woman fell ill. Her breathing grew ragged. Her voice faded.

And then, on the seventh evening, she called Belen to her mat.

No words.

Only a heaving sound—deep, guttural, like something crawling up her throat.

And then she vomited it out.

A **black mass**—round, pulsing faintly, like a heart that had forgotten how to beat. It steamed on the mat. Smelled of copper and sugar and rot.

She wrapped it in banana leaves.

Offered it to Belen.

Still no words.

Only waiting.

---

Belen held it.

She could have thrown it into the fire.

She could have fled.

But she remembered the girl who bled out in her arms.

She remembered how Biana looked at her after.

And she remembered the voice in her dreams, whispering:

> “You can stop the dying. You can own the birth.”

She placed the black mass to her lips.

And **swallowed**.

---

For three days she couldn’t speak.

The world bent around her.

She could hear the insects breathing. Smell the iron beneath the soil. And deeper still, she began to hear the unborn.

They spoke in pulses. In fears.

She returned to the village a month later.

No one remembered how old she was.

She never aged again.

---

> _“They think I bring death,”_ she once whispered to Mira. _“But I don’t. I bring a different kind of life.”_  
> _“They feed theirs with prayer. I feed mine with blood.”_  
> _“Both are hungry.”_
