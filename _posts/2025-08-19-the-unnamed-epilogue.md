**Epilogue**

_“The names were given, and the road lay clear.”_

---

The Sagayo compound felt different now.  
The air no longer clung cold to the skin; the shadows no longer reached for the living. Sunlight poured through the open windows of the sala, falling across the bare boards where the vigil chair had once stood. Outside, in a patch of bare earth, the last grey flakes of its ashes stirred in the wind, their scent of char long faded into the pines.

Two days after the exorcism, the family gathered for a smaller, quieter journey — to the burial cave.  
The same narrow path wound upward through the trees, but there was no heavy fog this time, only a thin morning mist that lifted with each step. The woven burial cloth, patterned in red and black, rested in Gabi’s arms. Beside him, Fr. Kin walked with a steady, deliberate gait, the wind tugging at his white hair. The welt along his cheek caught the light, the fresh scar still angry against his skin — a mark he would carry, even as the one on Len’s brow was gone.

They laid Lolo Ben to rest beside his brother. Levi’s name was stitched deep into the cloth, the carving on the marker still fresh from Gabi’s chisel. For a moment, Gabi let his hand rest on the stone — not only for Lolo Ben, but for the uncle he had never known, whose sin and repentance had both shaped their fate.  
No words were spoken; the act itself was the prayer. When the stone was set, Kin traced the cross over both graves and stepped back.

A week later, a letter arrived for Fr. Kin.  
The bishop’s seal broke with a dry snap, and Kin read it alone at the kitchen table.

> _Father Sagayo,_  
> _I have received your request. Given the seriousness of the matter, I am inclined to authorise further inquiry and—should sufficient cause be found—sanction the rite you have requested._  
> _I trust you will continue to exercise caution in all matters._  
> _In Christ,_  
> _† Manuel P. Ordono, Bishop of Baguio_

Kin let the paper fall shut. The faintest smile touched his lips — the timing of the reply said everything.

The mountains were sinking into shadow when Gabi found Len on the veranda. The wind caught her hair, strands of bronze lifting like they had that morning in the garden.

“I meant what I said,” he began, voice low. “I’m not leaving you behind again. Once I’m back, I’ll set things in motion. I want you there with me.”

She studied him, the space between them holding a decade of absence. “We dreamed about that once,” she said. “Before you vanished…” Her tone carried no sharpness, only the weight of years.

“I know.” He stepped closer until the same wind touched them both. “I ran from grief, from this place… from you. I see that now. And I’m done running.”

A flicker of uncertainty lingered in her eyes — the part of her that had learned not to trust promises. Yet something in her eased, as though the fog between them had thinned. She let out a soft laugh, brittle at the edges. “Australia still feels far away… and my parents are here.”

“They’ll be looked after,” he said. “Better, even. You could help them more from there. They'll be happy to see you build a new life.”

Her brow furrowed, the old tension between duty and desire passing through her eyes. But when he reached for her hand, she let his fingers close around hers.

For a moment, they stood in the hush between pines and hills, the noise of the compound fading into nothing. When she looked up, her gaze held the same unshaken grace he had seen through every trial — in Elia’s care, in the chaos of the sala, in the moment she fought back from the dark.

She studied him for a long moment, then let out a slow breath. “If you’re done running,” she said, “then I’m done waiting. I’ll hold you to it,” she added, the faintest smile tugging at her lips.

“I hope you do.” He bent and kissed her — slow, certain, sealing not just a promise but the years between them.

From inside, Anding’s voice called her name. Len lingered a heartbeat longer, her fingers brushing his before she turned, carrying the shape of him into the warm light of the house.

The next morning, the goodbyes were brief but heavy. 

Anding moved through the sala with uncharacteristic quiet, arranging flowers in the restored vases. When she caught Gabi’s eye, there was no challenge in her gaze — only a small nod, as if to say what words could not. He took her hand to his forehead in the old way, then went on his way.

In the corner, Elia crouched over a sheet of paper, drawing the mountains in bright colors. She looked up long enough to wave at him, the kind of wave a child gives when the day feels safe.

“The chair’s quiet now,” she said. “But the road still has voices.” Then she bent back over her drawing, as if she’d only been talking about the weather.

Gabi crossed the room and kissed the top of her head, his hand lingering for a moment in her hair. “I believe you, balong,” he murmured, and she smiled faintly before going back to her drawing.

Outside, Kin stood by the van, the mountain light catching the white in his hair and the welt that cut across his cheek.

“We’ve both got our work to do,” he said. His voice was quiet, but there was no mistaking the steadiness in it. “Yours is out there. Mine is here.”

For a moment, they held each other’s gaze — kin by blood, brothers by what they had endured. Gabi saw, in that look, the man who had risked everything for the family, and the priest who had chosen to bear the mark so others would walk free.

“Take care of them,” Gabi said.

“I will. And you—” Kin’s mouth curved into the faintest smile, “—don’t wait ten years to come back this time.”

They clasped shoulders, the gesture holding more than words, and stepped apart knowing they left each other stronger than they had found one another.

Len lingered in the doorway, offering a last wave that carried both promise and ache.

Gabi’s van wound down the long road from the hills.

The pines thinned, giving way to the wide curve where the fog often lay thick.  
There — in the hush between trunks — they drifted.  
Pale shapes, headless yet human in their bearing, gliding as if borne on an unseen tide. Morning light caught at the edges of their forms, making them shimmer like breath on glass.

One of them seemed to turn, just enough for Gabi to imagine — or believe — that the path they walked began somewhere near the cave. Perhaps it wound past the two graves, past Levi’s name newly carved in stone, past the one beside it still fresh in the earth.

He did not look away.  
They neither beckoned nor turned, but kept their slow procession, vanishing one by one into the deeper green. The forest seemed to fold over them, swallowing their pale glow until only shadow remained.

Anding’s words came back to him — _Don’t follow, don’t speak their names_. He let them pass, and they walked on without turning.

He leaned back in his seat as the road unwound ahead. The fog behind him loosened into the clear blue of the day.  
Some names were never spoken aloud — yet still carried on the wind.
